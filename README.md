# Capstone_OSU

## Description

CSE 5914 Capstone Project which aims to use make conspiracy theories (ADD)

## Usage

CD into `webapp` and do `npm start` to launch the webapp and database in dev mode.
CD into `webapp` and do `npm run test` to run tests.

If you have difficulty with packages (specifically if you get an error stating you're missing `rollup-linux-x64-gnu` or similar), run `npm run docker:npm-install`.

### Uploading data to the server

First run the app locally, or at least the update-data container. This will populate data/articles.

Then run the following commands from the project root:

- rsync -avzP ./db/data/articles root@conspiragen.com:~/db/data
- ssh root@conspiragen.com 'docker compose -f ~/compose.prod.yml up --build -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans import-data'

These commands don't exist on windows, so use WSL if necessary.
They require a valid SSH key to connect to the server.

Unfortunately the server cannot download the data directly without being rate limited.
