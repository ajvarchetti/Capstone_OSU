        "title": "Tartarian Empire",
        "wikipedia_content": "Tartarian Empire refers to a group of  pseudohistorical conspiracy theories, including ideas of a \"hidden past\" and \"mud floods\", which originated as pseudoscientific Russian nationalism.\nTartary, or Tartaria, is a historical name for Central Asia and Siberia. Conspiracy theories assert that Tartary, or the Tartarian Empire, was a lost civilization with advanced technology and culture. This ignores well-documented accounts of Tartary within the history of Asia. In the present day, Tartary covers a region spanning central Afghanistan to northern Kazakhstan as well as areas in Mongolia, China, and the Russian Far East.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe theory of Great Tartaria as a suppressed lost land or civilization originated in Russia, with aspects first appearing in Anatoly Fomenko's new chronology in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and was then popularized by the racial occult history of Nikolai Levashov. In Russian pseudoscience, known for its nationalism, Tartaria is presented as the \"real\" name for Russia, which was maliciously \"ignored\" in the West. The Russian Geographical Society has debunked the conspiracy theory as an extremist fantasy, and far from denying the existence of the term, has used the opportunity to share numerous maps of \"Tartary\" in its collection. Since about 2016, conspiracy theories about the supposed lost empire of \"Tartaria\" have gained popularity on the internet, divorced from its original Russian nationalist frame.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theory ==\n\nThe globalized version of the conspiracy theory is based on an alternative view of architectural history. Adherents propose that demolished buildings such as the Singer Building, the original New York Penn Station, and the temporary grounds of the 1915 World's Fair were actually the buildings of a vast empire based in Tartary that has been suppressed from history. Sumptuously styled Gilded Age buildings are often held out as really having been built by the supposed Tartaria. Other buildings, such as the Great Pyramids and the White House, are further held out as Tartarian constructions. The conspiracy theory only vaguely describes how such a supposedly advanced civilization, which had reputedly achieved world peace, could have fallen and been hidden.\n\nIn the conspiracy theory, the idea that a \"mud flood\" wiped out much of the world via depopulation and thus old buildings is common, supported by the fact that many buildings across the world have architectural elements like doors, windows, and archways submerged many feet below \"ground level\". Both World War I and II are cited as a way in which Tartaria was destroyed and hidden, reflecting the reality that the extensive bombing campaigns of World War II did destroy many historic buildings. The general evidence for the theory is that there are similar styles of building around the world, such as capitol buildings with domes, or star forts. Also, many photographs from the turn of the 20th century appear to show deserted city streets in many capital cities across the world. When people do start to appear in the photographs, there is a striking contrast between horse-and-cart users in the muddy streets and the elaborate, highly ornate stone mega-structures that tower above the inhabitants of the cities, which is seen even in modern cities where extreme poverty is contrasted with skyscrapers.\nZach Mortice, writing for Bloomberg, believes that the theory reflects a cultural discontent with modernism and a supposition that traditional styles are inherently good and modern styles are bad. He describes the theory as \"the QAnon of architecture\". Moritz Maurer, a religious scholar, links Tartarian imagery to the \"giant trees\" theory, in which colossal, flat buttes are envisioned as the stumps of primordial \"mother trees\" cut down at some point in the past by unknown nefarious agents. Maurer attributes the lack of a clear narrative for both conspiracies to the image-based social media on which they are presented, describing it as \"meme culture\" and also comparing it to QAnon.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient astronauts\nChinese Tartary, an archaic geographical term\nHyperborea, in Greek mythology, a mythical people in the far north of the world\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "title": "Illuminati",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Illuminati (; plural of Latin illuminatus, 'enlightened') is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in the Electorate of Bavaria. The society's stated goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power. \"The order of the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.\" The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790. During subsequent years, the group was generally vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that the Illuminati continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\nIt attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning Duke of Gotha and of Weimar.\nIn subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" has been used when referring to various organisations which are alleged to be a continuation of the original Bavarian Illuminati (though these links have not been substantiated). These organisations have often been accused of conspiring to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in governments and corporations, in order to gain political power, influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the more widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati are depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power. This view of the Illuminati has found its way into popular culture, appearing in dozens of novels, films, television shows, comics, video games and music videos.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nAdam Weishaupt (1748–1830) became professor of Canon Law and practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt in 1773. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order Pope Clement XIV had dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the university, which they continued to regard as their own. They made constant attempts to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment (Aufklärung) through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals.\nFinding Freemasonry expensive, and not open to his ideas, he founded his own society which was to have a system of ranks or grades based on those in Freemasonry, but with his own agenda. His original name for the new order was Bund der Perfektibilisten, or Covenant of Perfectibility (Perfectibilists); he later changed it because it sounded too strange. On 1 May 1776, Weishaupt and four students formed the Perfectibilists, taking the Owl of Minerva as their symbol. The members were to use aliases within the society. Weishaupt became Spartacus. Law students Massenhausen, Bauhof, Merz and Sutor became respectively Ajax, Agathon, Tiberius and Erasmus Roterodamus. Weishaupt later expelled Sutor for indolence. In April 1778, the order became the Illuminatenorden, or Order of Illuminati, after Weishaupt had seriously contemplated the name Bee order.\nMassenhausen proved initially the most active in expanding the society. Significantly, while studying in Munich shortly after the formation of the order, he recruited Xavier von Zwack, a former pupil of Weishaupt, at the beginning of Zwack's significant administrative career. (At the time, he was in charge of the Bavarian National Lottery.) Massenhausen's enthusiasm soon became a liability in the eyes of Weishaupt, often resulting in attempts to recruit unsuitable candidates. Later, his erratic love-life made him neglectful, and as Weishaupt passed control of the Munich group to Zwack, it became clear that Massenhausen had misappropriated subscriptions and intercepted correspondence between Weishaupt and Zwack. In 1778, Massenhausen graduated and took a post outside Bavaria, taking no further interest in the order. At this time, the order had a nominal membership of twelve.\nWith the departure of Massenhausen, Zwack immediately applied himself to recruiting more mature and important recruits. Most prized by Weishaupt was Hertel, a childhood friend and a canon of the Munich Frauenkirche. By the end of summer 1778 the order had 27 members (still counting Massenhausen) in 5 commands; Munich (Athens), Ingolstadt (Eleusis), Ravensberg (Sparta), Freysingen (Thebes), and Eichstaedt (Erzurum).\nDuring this early period, the order had three grades of Novice, Minerval and Illuminated Minerval, of which only the Minerval grade involved a complicated ceremony. In this the candidate was given secret signs and a password. A system of mutual espionage kept Weishaupt informed of the activities and character of all his members, his favourites becoming members of the ruling council, or Areopagus. Some novices were permitted to recruit, becoming Insinuants. Christians of good character were actively sought, with Jews and pagans specifically excluded, along with women, monks and members of other secret societies. Favoured candidates were rich, docile, willing to learn and aged 18–30.\n\n\n=== Transition ===\nHaving, with difficulty, dissuaded some of his members from joining the Freemasons, Weishaupt decided to join the older order to acquire material to expand his own ritual. He was admitted to lodge \"Prudence\" of the Rite of Strict Observance early in February 1777. His progress through the three degrees of \"blue lodge\" masonry taught him nothing of the higher degrees he sought to exploit, but in the following year a priest called Abbé Marotti informed Zwack that these inner secrets rested on knowledge of the older religion and the primitive church. Zwack persuaded Weishaupt that their own order should enter into friendly relations with Freemasonry and obtain the dispensation to set up their own lodge. At this stage (December 1778), the addition of the first three degrees of Freemasonry was seen as a secondary project.\nWith little difficulty, a warrant was obtained from the Grand Lodge of Prussia called the Royal York for Friendship, and the new lodge was called Theodore of the Good Council with the intention of flattering Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. It was founded in Munich on 21 March 1779 and quickly packed with Illuminati. The first master, a man called Radl, was persuaded to return home to Baden and by July Weishaupt's order ran the lodge.\nThe next step involved independence from their Grand Lodge. By establishing masonic relations with the Union lodge in Frankfurt, affiliated to the Premier Grand Lodge of England, lodge Theodore became independently recognised and able to declare its independence. As a new mother lodge, it could now spawn lodges of its own. The recruiting drive amongst the Frankfurt masons also obtained the allegiance of Adolph Freiherr Knigge.\n\n\n=== Reform ===\n\n\n==== Adolph Knigge ====\n\nKnigge was recruited late in 1780 at a convention of the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo, an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason. Knigge, still in his twenties, had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform. Disappointed that his scheme found no support, Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed. Knigge and three of his friends expressed a strong interest in learning more of this order and Costanzo showed them material relating to the Minerval grade. The teaching material for the grade was \"liberal\" literature which was banned in Bavaria, but common knowledge in the Protestant German states. Knigge's three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanzo, but Knigge's persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt. Knigge's connections, both within and outside of Freemasonry, made him an ideal recruit. Knigge, for his own part, was flattered by the attention and drawn towards the order's stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism. Weishaupt managed to acknowledge, and pledge to support, Knigge's interest in alchemy and the \"higher sciences\". Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins.\nWeishaupt set Knigge the task of recruiting before he could be admitted to the higher grades of the order. Knigge accepted, on the condition that he be allowed to choose his own recruiting grounds. Many other masons found Knigge's description of the new masonic order attractive and were enrolled in the Minerval grade of the Illuminati. Knigge appeared at this time to believe in the \"Most Serene Superiors\" which Weishaupt claimed to serve. His inability to articulate anything about the higher degrees of the order became increasingly embarrassing, but in delaying any help, Weishaupt gave him an extra task. Provided with material by Weishaupt, Knigge now produced pamphlets outlining the activities of the outlawed Jesuits, purporting to show how they continued to thrive and recruit, especially in Bavaria. Meanwhile, Knigge's inability to give his recruits any satisfactory response to questions regarding the higher grades was making his position untenable and he wrote to Weishaupt to this effect. In January 1781, faced with the prospect of losing Knigge and his masonic recruits, Weishaupt finally confessed that his superiors and the supposed antiquity of the order were fictions and the higher degrees had yet to be written.\nIf Knigge had expected to learn the promised deep secrets of Freemasonry in the higher degrees of the Illuminati, he was surprisingly calm about Weishaupt's revelation. Weishaupt promised Knigge a free hand in the creation of the higher degrees and also promised to send him his own notes. For his own part, Knigge welcomed the opportunity to use the order as a vehicle for his own ideas. His new approach would, he claimed, make the Illuminati more attractive to prospective members in the Protestant princedoms of Germany. In November 1781 the Areopagus advanced Knigge 50 florins to travel to Bavaria, which he did via Swabia and Franconia, meeting and enjoying the hospitality of other Illuminati on his journey.\n\n\n==== Internal problems ====\nThe order had now developed profound internal divisions. In July 1780, the Eichstaedt command had formed an autonomous province and a rift was growing between Weishaupt and the Areopagus, who found him stubborn, dictatorial, and inconsistent. Knigge fitted readily into the role of peacemaker.\nIn discussions with the Areopagus and Weishaupt, Knigge identified two areas which were problematic. Weishaupt's emphasis on the recruitment of university students meant that senior positions in the order often had to be filled by young men with little practical experience. Secondly, the anti-Jesuit ethos of the order at its inception had become a general anti-religious sentiment, which Knigge knew would be a problem in recruiting the senior Freemasons that the order now sought to attract. Knigge felt keenly the stifling grip of conservative Catholicism in Bavaria and understood the anti-religious feelings that this produced in the liberal Illuminati, but he also saw the negative impression these same feelings would engender in Protestant states, inhibiting the spread of the order in greater Germany. Both the Areopagus and Weishaupt felt powerless to do anything less than give Knigge a free hand. He had the contacts within and outside of Freemasonry that they needed and he had the skill as a ritualist to build their projected gradal structure, where they had ground to a halt at Illuminatus Minor, with only the Minerval grade below and the merest sketches of higher grades. The only restrictions imposed were the need to discuss the inner secrets of the highest grades and the necessity of submitting his new grades for approval.\nMeanwhile, the scheme to propagate Illuminatism as a legitimate branch of Freemasonry had stalled. While Lodge Theodore was now in their control, a chapter of \"Elect Masters\" attached to it only had one member from the order and still had a constitutional superiority to the craft lodge controlled by the Illuminati. The chapter would be difficult to persuade to submit to the Areopagus and formed a very real barrier to Lodge Theodore becoming the first mother-lodge of a new Illuminated Freemasonry. A treaty of alliance was signed between the order and the chapter and by the end of January 1781 four daughter lodges had been created, but independence was not in the chapter's agenda.\nCostanza wrote to the Royal York pointing out the discrepancy between the fees dispatched to their new Grand Lodge and the service they had received in return. The Royal York, unwilling to lose the revenue, offered to confer the \"higher\" secrets of Freemasonry on a representative that their Munich brethren would dispatch to Berlin. Costanza accordingly set off for Prussia on 4 April 1780, with instructions to negotiate a reduction in Theodore's fees while he was there. On the way, he managed to have an argument with a Frenchman on the subject of a lady with whom they were sharing a carriage. The Frenchman sent a message ahead to the king, some time before they reached Berlin, denouncing Costanza as a spy. He was only freed from prison with the help of the Grand Master of Royal York and was expelled from Prussia having accomplished nothing.\n\n\n==== New system ====\nKnigge's initial plan to obtain a constitution from London would, they realised, have been seen through by the chapter. Until such time as they could take over other masonic lodges that their chapter could not control, they were for the moment content to rewrite the three degrees for the lodges which they administered.\nOn 20 January 1782, Knigge tabulated his new system of grades for the order. These were arranged in three classes:\n\nClass I – The nursery, consisting of the Noviciate, the Minerval and Illuminatus minor.\nClass II – The Masonic grades. The three \"blue lodge\" grades of Apprentice, Companion and Master were separated from the higher \"Scottish\" grades of Scottish Novice and Scottish Knight.\nClass III – The Mysteries. The lesser mysteries were the grades of Priest and Prince, followed by the greater mysteries in the grades of Mage and King. It is unlikely that the rituals for the greater mysteries were ever written.\n\n\n=== Attempts at expansion ===\nKnigge's recruitment from German Freemasonry was far from random. He targeted the masters and wardens, the men who ran the lodges, and were often able to place the entire lodge at the disposal of the Illuminati. In Aachen, Baron de Witte, master of Constancy lodge, caused every member to join the order. In this way, the order expanded rapidly in central and southern Germany and obtained a foothold in Austria. Moving into the Spring of 1782, the handful of students that had started the order had swelled to about 300 members, only 20 of the new recruits being students.\nIn Munich, the first half of 1782 saw huge changes in the government of Lodge Theodore. In February, Weishaupt had offered to split the lodge, with the Illuminati going their own way and the chapter taking any remaining traditionalists into their own continuation of Theodore. At this point, the chapter unexpectedly capitulated and the Illuminati had complete control of lodge and chapter. In June, both lodge and chapter sent letters severing relations with Royal York, citing their own faithfulness in paying for their recognition and Royal York's failure to provide any instruction into the higher grades. Their neglect of Costanza, failure to defend him from malicious charges or prevent his expulsion from Prussia, were also cited. They had made no effort to provide Costanza with the promised secrets and the Munich masons now suspected that their brethren in Berlin relied on the mystical French higher grades which they sought to avoid. Lodge Theodore was now independent.\nThe Rite of Strict Observance was now in a critical state. Its nominal leader was Prince Carl of Södermanland (later Charles XIII of Sweden), openly suspected of trying to absorb the rite into the Swedish Rite, which he already controlled. The German lodges looked for leadership to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Suspicion turned to open contempt when it transpired that Carl regarded the Stuart heir to the British throne as the true Grand Master and the lodges of the Strict Observance all but ignored their Grand Master. This impasse led to the Convent of Wilhelmsbad.\n\n\n==== Convent of Wilhelmsbad ====\n\nDelayed from 15 October 1781, the last convention of the Strict Observance finally opened on 16 July 1782 in the spa town of Wilhelmsbad on the outskirts of (now part of) Hanau. Ostensibly a discussion of the future of the order, the 35 delegates knew that the Strict Observance in its current form was doomed, and that the Convent of Wilhelmsbad would be a struggle over the pieces between the German mystics, under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and their host Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, and the Martinists, under Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. The only dissenting voices to mystical higher grades were Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, who was horrified by Martinism, but whose proposed alternatives were as yet unformed, and Franz Dietrich von Ditfurth, a judge from Wetzlar and master of the Joseph of the Three Helmets lodge there, who was already a member of the Illuminati. Ditfurth publicly campaigned for a return to the basic three degrees of Freemasonry, which was the least likely outcome of the convention. The mystics already had coherent plans to replace the higher degrees.\nThe lack of a coherent alternative to the two strains of mysticism allowed the Illuminati to present themselves as a credible option. Ditfurth, prompted and assisted by Knigge, who now had full authority to act for the order, became their spokesman. Knigge's original plan to propose an alliance between the two orders was rejected by Weishaupt, who saw no point in an alliance with a dying order. His new plan was to recruit the masons opposed to the \"Templar\" higher degree of the Strict Observance.\nAt the convent, Ditfurth blocked the attempts of Willermoz and Hesse to introduce their own higher grades by insisting that full details of such degrees be revealed to the delegates. The frustration of the German mystics led to their enrolling Count Kollowrat with the Illuminati with a view to later affiliation. Ditfurth's own agenda was to replace all of the higher degrees with a single fourth degree, with no pretensions to further masonic revelations. Finding no support for his plan, he left the convent prematurely, writing to the Areopagus that he expected nothing good of the assembly.\nIn an attempt to satisfy everybody, the Convent of Wilhelmsbad achieved little. They renounced the Templar origins of their ritual, while retaining the Templar titles, trappings and administrative structure. Charles of Hesse and Ferdinand of Brunswick remained at the head of the order, but in practice the lodges were almost independent. The Germans also adopted the name of the French order of Willermoz, les Chevaliers bienfaisants de la Cité sainte (Good Knights of the Holy City), and some Martinist mysticism was imported into the first three degrees, which were now the only essential degrees of Freemasonry. Crucially, individual lodges of the order were now allowed to fraternise with lodges of other systems. The new \"Scottish Grade\" introduced with the Lyon ritual of Willermoz was not compulsory, each province and prefecture was free to decide what, if anything, happened after the three craft degrees. Finally, in an effort to show that something had been achieved, the convent regulated at length on etiquette, titles and a new numbering for the provinces.\n\n\n==== Aftermath of Wilhelmsbad ====\nWhat the Convent of Wilhelmsbad actually achieved was the demise of the Strict Observance. It renounced its own origin myth, along with the higher degrees which bound its highest and most influential members. It abolished the strict control which had kept the order united and alienated many Germans who mistrusted Martinism. Bode, who was repelled by Martinism, immediately entered negotiations with Knigge and finally joined the Illuminati in January 1783. Charles of Hesse joined the following month.\nKnigge's first efforts at an alliance with the intact German Grand Lodges failed, but Weishaupt persisted. He proposed a new federation where all of the German lodges would practise an agreed, unified system in the essential three degrees of Freemasonry and be left to their own devices as to which, if any, system of higher degrees they wished to pursue. This would be a federation of Grand Lodges and members would be free to visit any of the \"blue\" lodges, in any jurisdiction. All lodge masters would be elected and no fees would be paid to any central authority whatsoever. Groups of lodges would be subject to a \"Scottish Directorate\", composed of members delegated by lodges, to audit finances, settle disputes and authorise new lodges. These in turn would elect Provincial Directorates, who would elect inspectors, who would elect the national director. This system would correct the current imbalance in German Freemasonry, where masonic ideals of equality were preserved only in the lower three \"symbolic\" degrees. The various systems of higher degrees were dominated by the elite who could afford researches in alchemy and mysticism. To Weishaupt and Knigge, the proposed federation was also a vehicle to propagate Illuminism throughout German Freemasonry. Their intention was to use their new federation, with its emphasis on the fundamental degrees, to remove all allegiance to Strict Observance, allowing the \"eclectic\" system of the Illuminati to take its place.\nThe circular announcing the new federation outlined the faults of German freemasonry, that unsuitable men with money were often admitted on the basis of their wealth, that the corruption of civil society had infected the lodges. Having advocated the deregulation of the higher grades of the German lodges, the Illuminati now announced their own, from their \"unknown Superiors\". Lodge Theodore, newly independent from Royal York, set themselves up as a provincial Grand Lodge. Knigge, in a letter to all the Royal York lodges, now accused that Grand Lodge of decadence. Their Freemasonry had allegedly been corrupted by the Jesuits. Strict Observance was now attacked as a creation of the Stuarts, devoid of all moral virtue. The Zinnendorf rite of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany was suspect because its author was in league with the Swedes. This direct attack had the opposite effect to that intended by Weishaupt, it offended many of its readers. The Grand Lodge of the Grand Orient of Warsaw, which controlled Freemasonry in Poland and Lithuania, was happy to participate in the federation only as far as the first three degrees. Their insistence on independence had kept them from the Strict Observance and would now keep them from the Illuminati, whose plan to annex Freemasonry rested on their own higher degrees. By the end of January 1783 the Illuminati's masonic contingent had seven lodges.\nIt was not only the clumsy appeal of the Illuminati that left the federation short of members. Lodge Theodore was recently formed and did not command respect like the older lodges. Most of all, the Freemasons most likely to be attracted to the federation saw the Illuminati as an ally against the mystics and Martinists, but valued their own freedom too highly to be caught in another restrictive organisation. Even Ditfurth, the supposed representative of the Illuminati at Wilhelmsbad, had pursued his own agenda at the convent.\nThe non-mystical Frankfurt lodges created an \"Eclectic Alliance\", which was almost indistinguishable in constitution and aims from the Illuminati's federation. Far from seeing this as a threat, after some discussion the Illuminati lodges joined the new alliance. Three Illuminati now sat on the committee charged with writing the new masonic statutes. Aside from strengthening relations between their three lodges, the Illuminati seem to have gained no advantage from this manoeuvre. Ditfurth, having found a masonic organisation that worked towards his own ambitions for Freemasonry, took little interest in the Illuminati after his adherence to the Eclectic Alliance. In reality, the creation of the Eclectic Alliance had undermined all of the subtle plans of the Illuminati to spread their own doctrine through Freemasonry.\n\n\n=== Zenith ===\nAlthough their hopes of mass recruitment through Freemasonry had been frustrated, the Illuminati continued to recruit well at an individual level. In Bavaria, the succession of Charles Theodore initially led to a liberalisation of attitudes and laws, but the clergy and courtiers, guarding their own power and privilege, persuaded the weak-willed monarch to reverse his reforms and Bavaria's repression of liberal thought returned. This reversal led to a general resentment of the monarch and the church among the educated classes, which provided a perfect recruiting ground for the Illuminati. A number of Freemasons from Prudence lodge, disaffected by the Martinist rites of the Chevaliers Bienfaisants, joined lodge Theodore, who set themselves up in a gardened mansion which contained their library of liberal literature.\nIlluminati circles in the rest of Germany expanded. While some had only modest gains, the circle in Mainz almost doubled from 31 to 61 members. Reaction to state Catholicism led to gains in Austria and footholds were obtained in Warsaw, Pressburg (Bratislava), Tyrol, Milan and Switzerland.\nThe total number of verifiable members at the end of 1784 is around 650. Weishaupt and Hertel later claimed a figure of 2,500. The higher figure is largely explained by the inclusion of members of masonic lodges that the Illuminati claimed to control, but it is likely that the names of all the Illuminati are not known and the true figure lies somewhere around 1,300. The importance of the order lay in its successful recruitment of the professional classes, churchmen, academics, doctors and lawyers, and its more recent acquisition of powerful benefactors. Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg with his brother and later successor August, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg governor of Erfurt, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (already mentioned), his chief assistant in masonic matters, Johann Friedrich von Schwarz and Count Metternich of Koblenz were all enrolled. In Vienna, Count Brigido, governor of Galicia, Count Leopold Kolowrat, chancellor of Bohemia with his vice-Chancellor Baron Kressel, Count Pálffy von Erdöd, chancellor of Hungary, Count Banffy, governor and provincial Grand Master of Transylvania, Count Stadion, ambassador to London, and Baron von Swieten, minister of public education, also joined.\nThere were notable failures. Johann Kaspar Lavater, the Swiss poet and theologian, rebuffed Knigge. He did not believe the order's humanitarian and rationalist aims were achievable by secret means. He further believed that a society's drive for members would ultimately submerge its founding ideals. Christoph Friedrich Nicolai, the Berlin writer and bookseller, became disillusioned after joining. He found its aims chimeric and thought that the use of Jesuit methods to achieve their aims was dangerous. He remained in the order, but took no part in recruitment.\n\n\n=== Conflict with Rosicrucians ===\n\nAt all costs, Weishaupt wished to keep the existence of the order secret from the Rosicrucians, who already had a considerable foothold in German Freemasonry. While clearly Protestant, the Rosicrucians were anything but anticlerical, were pro-monarchic and held views clearly conflicting with the Illuminati vision of a rationalist state run by philosophers and scientists. The Rosicrucians were not above promoting their own brand of mysticism with seances. A conflict became inevitable as the existence of the Illuminati became more evident, and as prominent Rosicrucians and mystics with Rosicrucian sympathies, were recruited by Knigge and other helpers. Kolowrat was already a high ranking Rosicrucian and the mystic Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel had a very low opinion of the rationalist higher grades of the Illuminati.\nMonika Neugebauer-Wölk states that the Illuminati cultivated not only Enlightenment rationalism, but also Christian theosophy and Gnosticism and were not unfriendly to the original Rosicrucian manifestos, which they regarded as the forerunners of the Enlightenment. She states that the Illuminati could be understood as yet another Freemasonic or Rosicrucian utopia.\nThe Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, began a sustained attack on the Illuminati. Wöllner had a specially engineered room in which he convinced potential patrons of the effectiveness of Rosicrucian \"magic\", and his order had acquired effective control of the \"Three Globes\" and its attached lodges. Through this mouthpiece, the Illuminati were accused of atheism and revolutionary tendencies. In April 1783, Frederick the Great informed Charles of Hesse that the Berlin lodges had documents belonging to the Minervals or Illuminati which contained appalling material and asked if he had heard of them. All Berlin masons were now warned against the order, which was now accused of Socinianism, and of using the liberal writings of Voltaire and others, alongside the tolerance of Freemasonry, to undermine all religion. In November 1783, the Three Globes described the Illuminati as a masonic sect which sought to undermine Christianity and turn Freemasonry into a political system. Their final anathema, in November 1784, refused to recognise any Illuminati as Freemasons.\nIn Austria, the Illuminati were blamed for anti-religious pamphlets that had recently appeared. The Rosicrucians spied on Joseph von Sonnenfels and other suspected Illuminati, and their campaign of denunciation within Freemasonry completely shut down Illuminati recruitment in Tyrol.\nThe Bavarian Illuminati, whose existence was already known to the Rosicrucians from an informant, were further betrayed by Ferdinand Maria Baader, an Areopagite who now joined the Rosicrucians. Shortly after his admission it was made known to his superiors that he was one of the Illuminati and he was informed that he could not be a member of both organisations. His letter of resignation stated that the Rosicrucians did not possess secret knowledge, and ignored the truly Illuminated, specifically identifying Lodge Theodore as an Illuminati Lodge.\n\n\n=== Internal dissent ===\nAs the Illuminati embraced Freemasonry and expanded outside Bavaria, the council of the Areopagites was replaced by an ineffective \"Council of Provincials\". The Areopagites, however, remained as powerful voices within the Order and began again to bicker with Weishaupt as soon as Knigge left Munich. Weishaupt responded by privately slandering his perceived enemies in letters to his perceived friends.\nMore seriously, Weishaupt succeeded in alienating Knigge. Weishaupt had ceded considerable power to Knigge in deputising him to write the ritual, power he now sought to regain. Knigge had elevated the Order from a tiny anti-clerical club to a large organisation and felt that his work was under-acknowledged. Weishaupt's continuing anti-clericalism clashed with Knigge's mysticism, and recruitment of mystically inclined Freemasons was a cause of friction with Weishaupt and other senior Illuminati, such as Ditfurth. Matters came to a head over the grade of Priest. The consensus among many of the Illuminati was that the ritual was florid and ill-conceived, and the regalia puerile and expensive. Some refused to use it, others edited it. Weishaupt demanded that Knigge rewrite the ritual. Knigge pointed out that it was already circulated, with Weishaupt's blessing, as ancient. This fell on deaf ears. Weishaupt now claimed to other Illuminati that the Priest ritual was flawed because Knigge had invented it. Offended, Knigge now threatened to tell the world how much of the Illuminati ritual he had made up. Knigge's attempt to create a convention of the Areopagites proved fruitless, as most of them trusted him even less than they trusted Weishaupt. In July 1784 Knigge left the order by agreement, under which he returned all relevant papers, and Weishaupt published a retraction of all slanders against him. In forcing Knigge out, Weishaupt deprived the order of its best theoretician, recruiter and apologist.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nThe final decline of the Illuminati was brought about by the indiscretions of their own Minervals in Bavaria, and especially in Munich. In spite of efforts by their superiors to curb loose talk, politically dangerous boasts of power and criticism of monarchy caused the \"secret\" order's existence to become common knowledge, along with the names of many important members. The presence of Illuminati in positions of power now led to some public disquiet. There were Illuminati in many civic and state governing bodies. In spite of their small number, there were claims that success in a legal dispute depended on the litigant's standing with the order. The Illuminati were blamed for several anti-religious publications then appearing in Bavaria. Much of this criticism sprang from vindictiveness and jealousy, but it is clear that many Illuminati court officials gave preferential treatment to their brethren. In Bavaria, the energy of their two members of the Ecclesiastical Council had one of them elected treasurer. Their opposition to Jesuits resulted in the banned order losing key academic and church positions. In Ingolstadt, the Jesuit heads of department were replaced by Illuminati.\nAlarmed, Charles Theodore and his government banned all secret societies including the Illuminati. A government edict dated 2 March 1785 \"seems to have been deathblow to the Illuminati in Bavaria\". Weishaupt had fled and documents and internal correspondence, seized in 1786 and 1787, were subsequently published by the government in 1787.\n\n\n== Barruel and Robison ==\nBetween 1797 and 1798, Augustin Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism and John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy publicised the theory that the Illuminati had survived and represented an ongoing international conspiracy. This included the claim that it was behind the French Revolution. Both books proved to be very popular, spurring reprints and paraphrases by others. A prime example of this is Proofs of the Real Existence, and Dangerous Tendency, Of Illuminism by Reverend Seth Payson, published in 1802. Some of the response to this was critical, for example Jean-Joseph Mounier's On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France.\nBarruel, a Jesuit exiled from France, using some ideas plagiarized from John Robison, peddled a conspiracy theory that Jews, Freemasons and Illuminati want to demolish all monarchies plus the Vatican, in order to establish a World Republic. But Barruel did not accuse all Freemasons, and considered himself to be a Freemason. Barruel accused the Knight Templars that they secretly survived and they have infiltrated Freemasonry in order to destroy Christianity.\nBarruel's original idea was to depict Jews as engaged in a global conspiracy, a driving force of world history (till then the general consensus was that the Jews are too powerless to do that). Later, Barruel refrained from republishing his book \"fearing that it would lead to a massacre of the Jews.\"\nThe works of Robison and Barruel made their way to the United States and across New England. The Rev. Jedidiah Morse, an orthodox Congregational minister and geographer, was among those who delivered sermons against the Illuminati. In fact, one of the first accounts of the Illuminati to be printed in the United States was Morse's Fast Day sermon of 9 May 1798. Morse had been alerted to the publication in Europe of Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy by a letter from the Rev. John Erskine of Edinburgh, and he read Proofs shortly after copies published in Europe arrived by ship in March of that year. Other anti-Illuminati writers, such as Timothy Dwight, soon followed in their condemnation of the imagined group of conspirators.\nPrinted sermons were followed by newspaper accounts and these figured in the partisan political discourse leading up to the 1800 U.S. presidential election. The subsequent panic also contributed to the development of gothic literature in the United States. At least two novels from the period make reference to the crisis: Ormond; or, The Secret Witness (1799) and Julia, and the Illuminated Baron (1800). Some scholars, moreover, have linked the panic over the alleged Illuminati conspiracy to fears about immigration from the Caribbean and about potential slave rebellions. Concern died down in the first decade of the 1800s, although it revived from time to time in the Anti-Masonic movement of the 1820s and 30s.\n\n\n== Modern Illuminati ==\nSeveral recent and present-day fraternal orders claim to be descended from the original Bavarian Illuminati and openly use the name \"Illuminati\". Some of these groups use a variation on the name \"The Illuminati Order\" in the name of their own organisations, while others, such as Ordo Templi Orientis, have Epopt or Perfect Pontiff of the Illuminati as a grade within their organisation's degree structure. However, there is no evidence that these present-day groups have any real connection to the historic order. They have not amassed significant political power or influence and most, rather than trying to remain secret, promote unsubstantiated links to the Bavarian Illuminati as a means of attracting membership.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe original Illuminati did not survive suppression in Bavaria. Their further mischief and plottings in the work of Barruel and Robison must be thus considered as the invention of the writers. Despite this, many modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati. Some of the historical events conspiracy theorists falsely claim were orchestrated by the Illuminati include the French Revolution, the 1800 United States presidential election, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEsotericism in Germany and Austria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "title": "Dead Internet theory",
        "wikipedia_content": "The dead Internet theory is a conspiracy theory that asserts, due to a coordinated and intentional effort, the Internet now consists mainly of bot activity and automatically generated content manipulated by algorithmic curation to control the population and minimize organic human activity. Proponents of the theory believe these social bots were created intentionally to help manipulate algorithms and boost search results in order to manipulate consumers. Some proponents of the theory accuse government agencies of using bots to manipulate public perception. The date given for this \"death\" is generally around 2016 or 2017. The dead Internet theory has gained traction because many of the observed phenomena are quantifiable, such as increased bot traffic, but the literature on the subject does not support the full theory. \n\n\n== Origins and spread ==\nThe dead Internet theory's exact origin is difficult to pinpoint. In 2021, a post titled \"Dead Internet Theory: Most Of The Internet Is Fake\" was published onto the forum Agora Road's Macintosh Cafe esoteric board by a user named \"IlluminatiPirate\", claiming to be building on previous posts from the same board and from Wizardchan, and marking the term's spread beyond these initial imageboards. The conspiracy theory has entered public culture through widespread coverage and has been discussed on various high-profile YouTube channels. It gained more mainstream attention with an article in The Atlantic titled \"Maybe You Missed It, but the Internet 'Died' Five Years Ago\". This article has been widely cited by other articles on the topic.\n\n\n== Claims ==\nThe dead Internet theory has two main components: that organic human activity on the web has been displaced by bots and algorithmically curated search results, and that state actors are doing this in a coordinated effort to manipulate the human population. The first part of this theory, that bots create much of the content on the internet and perhaps contribute more than organic human content, has been a concern for a while, with the original post by \"IlluminatiPirate\" citing the article \"How Much of the Internet Is Fake? Turns Out, a Lot of It, Actually\" in New York magazine. The Dead Internet Theory goes on to include that Google, and other search engines, are censoring the Web by filtering content that is not desirable by limiting what is indexed and presented in search results. While Google may suggest that there are millions of search results for a query, the results available to a user do not reflect that.  This problem is exacerbated by the phenomenon known as link rot, which is caused when content at a website becomes unavailable, and all links to it on other sites break.  This has led to the theory that Google is a Potemkin village, and the searchable Web is much smaller than we are led to believe. The Dead Internet Theory suggests that this is part of the conspiracy to limit users to curated, and potentially artificial, content online.\nThe second half of the dead Internet theory builds on this observable phenomenon by proposing that the U.S. government, corporations, or other actors are intentionally limiting users to curated, and potentially artificial AI-generated content, to manipulate the human population for a variety of reasons. In the original post, the idea that bots have displaced human content is described as the \"setup\", with the \"thesis\" of the theory itself focusing on the United States government being responsible for this, stating: \"The U.S. government is engaging in an artificial intelligence-powered gaslighting of the entire world population.\"\n\n\n== Expert view ==\nCaroline Busta, founder of the media platform New Models, was quoted in a 2021 article in The Atlantic calling much of the dead Internet theory a \"paranoid fantasy,\" even if there are legitimate criticisms involving bot traffic and the integrity of the internet, but she said she does agree with the \"overarching idea.” In an article in The New Atlantis, Robert Mariani called the theory a mix between a genuine conspiracy theory and a creepypasta.\nIn 2024, the dead Internet theory was sometimes used to refer to the observable increase in content generated via large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT appearing in popular Internet spaces without mention of the full theory.\n\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n\n=== Large language models ===\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) are a class of large language models (LLMs) that employ artificial neural networks to produce human-like content. The first of these to be well known was developed by OpenAI. These models have created significant controversy. For example, Timothy Shoup of the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies said in 2022, \"in the scenario where GPT-3 'gets loose', the internet would be completely unrecognizable\". He predicted that in such a scenario, 99% to 99.9% of content online might be AI-generated by 2025 to 2030. These predictions have been used as evidence for the dead internet theory. \nIn 2024, Google reported that its search results were being inundated with websites that \"feel like they were created for search engines instead of people\". In correspondence with Gizmodo, a Google spokesperson acknowledged the role of generative AI in the rapid proliferation of such content and that it could displace more valuable human-made alternatives. Bots using LLMs are anticipated to increase the amount of spam, and run the risk of creating a situation where bots interacting with each other create \"self-replicating prompts\" that result in loops only human users could disrupt. \n\n\n==== ChatGPT ====\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot whose late 2022 release to the general public led journalists to call the dead internet theory potentially more realistic than before. Before ChatGPT's release, the dead internet theory mostly emphasized government organizations, corporations, and tech-literate individuals. ChatGPT gives the average internet user access to large-language models. This technology caused concern that the Internet would become filled with content created through the use of AI that would drown out organic human content.\n\n\n=== Bot traffic ===\nIn 2016, the security firm Imperva released a report on bot traffic and found that automated programs were responsible for 52% of web traffic. This report has been used as evidence in reports on the dead Internet theory. Imperva's report for 2023 found that 49.6% of internet traffic was automated, a 2% rise on 2022 which was partly attributed to artificial intelligence models scraping the web for training content.\n\n\n=== Facebook ===\n\nIn 2024, AI-generated images on Facebook, referred to as \"AI slop\", began going viral. Subjects of these AI-generated images included various iterations of Jesus \"meshed in various forms\" with shrimp, flight attendants, and black children next to artwork they supposedly created. Many of those said iterations have hundreds or even thousands of AI comments that say \"Amen\". These images have been referred as an example for why the Internet feels \"dead\".\nFacebook includes an option to provide AI-generated responses to group posts. Such responses appear if a user explicitly tags @MetaAI in a post, or if the post includes a question and no other users have responded to it within an hour.\nIn January 2025, interest renewed in the theory following statements from Meta on their plans to introduce new AI powered autonomous accounts. Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta stated, “We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do...They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.” \n\n\n=== Reddit ===\n\nIn the past, Reddit allowed free access to its API and data, which allowed users to employ third-party moderation apps and train AI in human interaction. In 2023, the company moved to charge for access to its user dataset. Companies training AI are expected to continue to use this data for training future AI. As LLMs such as ChatGPT become available to the general public, they are increasingly being employed on Reddit by users and bot accounts. Professor Toby Walsh of the University of New South Wales said in an interview with Business Insider that training the next generation of AI on content created by previous generations could cause the content to suffer. University of South Florida professor John Licato compared this situation of AI-generated web content flooding Reddit to the dead Internet theory.\n\n\n=== Twitter ===\n\n\n==== \"I hate texting\" tweets ====\nSince 2020, several Twitter accounts started posting tweets starting with the phrase \"I hate texting\" followed by an alternative activity, such as \"i hate texting i just want to hold ur hand\", or \"i hate texting just come live with me\". These posts received tens of thousands of likes, many of which are suspected to be from bot accounts. Proponents of the dead internet theory have used these accounts as an example.\n\n\n==== Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter ====\n\nThe proportion of Twitter accounts run by bots became a major issue during Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Musk disputed Twitter's claim that fewer than 5% of their monetizable daily active users (mDAU) were bots. Musk commissioned the company Cyabra to estimate what percentage of Twitter accounts were bots, with one study estimating 13.7% and another estimating 11%. CounterAction, another firm commissioned by Musk, estimated 5.3% of accounts were bots. Some bot accounts provide services, such as one noted bot that can provide stock prices when asked, while others troll, spread misinformation, or try to scam users. Believers in the dead Internet theory have pointed to this incident as evidence.\n\n\n=== TikTok ===\nIn 2024, TikTok began discussing offering the use of virtual influencers to advertisement agencies. In a 2024 article in Fast Company, journalist Michael Grothaus linked this and other AI-generated content on social media to the Dead Internet Theory. In this article, he referred to the content as \"AI-slime\".\n\n\n=== YouTube \"The Inversion\" ===\nOn YouTube, there is a market online for fake views to boost a video's credibility and reach broader audiences. At one point, fake views were so prevalent that some engineers were concerned YouTube's algorithm for detecting them would begin to treat the fake views as default and start misclassifying real ones. YouTube engineers coined the term \"the Inversion\" to describe this phenomenon. YouTube bots and the fear of \"the Inversion\" were cited as support for the dead Internet theory in a thread on the internet forum Melonland.\n\n\n=== SocialAI ===\nSocialAI, an app created on September 18, 2024, was created with the full purpose of chatting with only AI bots without human interaction. Its creator was Michael Sayman, a former product lead at Google who also worked at Facebook, Roblox, and Twitter. An article on the Ars Technica website linked SocialAI to the Dead Internet Theory.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe dead internet theory has been discussed among users of the social media platform Twitter. Users have noted that bot activity has affected their experience. Numerous YouTube channels and online communities, including the Linus Tech Tips forums and Joe Rogan subreddit, have covered the dead Internet theory, which has helped to advance the idea into mainstream discourse. There has also been discussion and memes about this topic on the app TikTok, due to the fact that AI generated content has become more mainstream.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "List of conspiracy theories",
        "wikipedia_content": "This is a list of notable conspiracy theories. Many conspiracy theories relate to supposed clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. They usually deny consensus opinion and cannot be proven using historical or scientific methods, and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies, such as Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II.\nIn principle, conspiracy theories might not always be false, and their validity depends on evidence as for any theory. However, they are often implausible prima facie due to their convoluted and all-encompassing nature. Conspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them.\nPsychologists sometimes attribute proclivities toward conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and insecure attachment, or to a form of cognitive bias called \"illusory pattern perception\". However, the current scientific consensus holds that most conspiracy theorists are not pathological, but merely exaggerate certain cognitive tendencies that are universal in the human brain and probably have deep evolutionary origins, such as natural inclinations towards anxiety and agent detection.\n\n\n== Aviation ==\nNumerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the Kashmir Princess, the 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crash, the 1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash, the 1987 Helderberg Disaster, the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the 1994 Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play that deviate from official verdicts.\n\n\n=== Black helicopters ===\n\nThis conspiracy theory emerged in the US in the 1960s. The John Birch Society originally promoted it, asserting that a United Nations force would soon arrive in black helicopters to bring the US under UN control. A similar theory concerning so-called \"phantom helicopters\" appeared in the UK in the 1970s. The theory re-emerged in the 1990s during the presidency of Bill Clinton, and was \"energetically\" promoted by writer Jim Keith in his book Black Helicopters Over America. By the 2000s, the term \"black helicopters\" became a shorthand for anti-government conspiracy theories that \"stretch the bounds of credulity\", such as those espoused by militia groups and a number of guests of talk show host Glenn Beck.\n\n\n=== Chemtrails ===\n\nAlso known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails (\"contrails\") from aircraft consist of chemical or biological agents, or contain a supposedly toxic mix of aluminum, strontium and barium, under secret government policies. An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the Carnegie Institution for Science published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor sampling.\n\n\n=== Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ===\nThe destruction of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers' remains by giant crabs.\n\n\n=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ===\n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories. One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as Flight MH17 later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes. American conspiracy theorist James H. Fetzer has placed responsibility for the disappearance with the then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Historian Norman Davies has promoted the conspiracy theory that hackers remotely took over a Boeing Uninterruptible Autopilot, supposedly installed on board, remotely piloting the aircraft to Antarctica.\n\n\n=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 ===\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly Flight MH370, that the plane was actually shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force to frame Russia, that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the \"truth\" about HIV (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the Illuminati or Israel was responsible.\n\n\n== Business and industry ==\n\n\n=== Deepwater Horizon ===\nMultiple conspiracy theories pertain to a fatal oil-rig industrial accident in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories had been suggested or promoted by US radio host Rush Limbaugh.\n\n\n=== New Coke ===\n\nA theory claims that the Coca-Cola Company intentionally changed to an inferior formula with New Coke, with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients. Coca-Cola president Donald Keough rebutted this charge: \"The truth is, we're not that dumb, and we're not that smart.\"\n\n\n== Deaths and disappearances ==\n\n\n=== Death of Nero ===\nIn ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero, who committed suicide in 68 AD. Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to reestablish his reign. In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still influential. Other theories held that Nero would return from the dead to retake his throne. Many early Christians feared Nero's return to resume his vicious anti-Christian persecutions. The Book of Revelation may allude to these conspiracy theories in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life.\n\n\n=== John F. Kennedy assassination ===\n\nIn modern times, multiple conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 have emerged. Vincent Bugliosi estimated that over 1,000 books had been written about the Kennedy assassination, at least ninety percent of which are works supporting the view that there was a conspiracy. As a result of this, the Kennedy assassination has been described as \"the mother of all conspiracies\". The countless individuals and organizations that have been accused of involvement in the Kennedy assassination include the CIA, the Mafia, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the KGB, or even some combination thereof. It is also frequently asserted that the United States federal government intentionally covered up crucial information in the aftermath of the assassination to prevent the conspiracy from being discovered.\n\n\n=== Disappearance of Harold Holt ===\n\nAt approximately 12:20pm on 17 December 1967, then–Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt, disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach, near the town of Portsea in Victoria. While it is presumed that Holt drowned, the topic is still described as one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in Australian history and has spawned many conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theories have been widely criticised by the public and by members of Holt's own family.\nIn 2007, television presenter Ray Martin hosted the television special Who Killed Harold Holt?, which first aired on the Nine Network on 20 November 2007. While the special explored numerous theories about Holt's disappearance, it gave particular credence to the theory that he committed suicide. In the lead-up to the airing of the program, Holt's biographer, Tom Frame, described the allegations made in the special as \"unjustified and contrary to all the evidence\" in an opinion piece published in The Australian newspaper, while Holt's son, Sam, said he was \"amazed that people can still keep bringing up [these] fallacious theories\".\nAnother conspiracy theory is that Holt was actually a spy for the Chinese government (under both the Nationalist and Communist governments) ever since he began studying at the University of Melbourne in 1929 and that he \"pretended to drown\", instead theorising that once below the surface two Chinese frogmen transported him to China in a submarine. This theory also claims that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) covered up any evidence. This theory was first promoted in British writer Anthony Grey's 1983 novel The Prime Minister Was a Spy, which attracted controversy in Australia. Other conspiracy theories claim that Holt was assassinated. Targets of these claims include North Vietnam and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n\n=== Death of other prominent figures ===\nThe deaths of prominent figures of all types attract conspiracy theorists, sometimes elaborating on historically verified conspiracies such as the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln, as well as the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr., Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Eric V of Denmark, Dmitry Ivanovich, Sheikh Rahman, Yitzhak Rabin, Zachary Taylor, George S. Patton, Diana, Princess of Wales, Dag Hammarskjöld, Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe, Tupac Shakur, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, the Notorious B.I.G., Pope John Paul I, Jill Dando, Olof Palme, Linkin Park member Chester Bennington, Paul Walker, biological warfare authority David Kelly, Haitian president Jovenel Moïse, Indian freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, and Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput.\nThere are also claims that deaths were covered up. Such theories include the \"Paul is dead\" claim alleging that Paul McCartney died in a car accident in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike Scottish orphan named William Shears Campbell who also went by Billy Shears, and that the Beatles hinted at this in their songs, most noticeably \"Revolution 9\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Glass Onion\", and \"I Am the Walrus\", as well on the covers of Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Magical Mystery Tour. Another is the conspiracy theory, widely circulated in Nigeria, which alleges that Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari died in 2017 and was replaced by a look-alike Sudanese impostor. Many fans of punk-pop star Avril Lavigne claim that she died at the height of her fame and was replaced by a look-alike named Melissa. The Melania Trump replacement theory proposes the same of the former US First Lady.\nInverted theories concerning deaths are also known, prominently claims that Elvis Presley's death was faked and that Adolf Hitler survived the Second World War and fled to the Americas, to Antarctica, or to the Moon. Theories that Hitler had survived are known to have been deliberately promoted by the government of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as part of a disinformation campaign.\nThe disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists. Theories of a cover-up surrounding the 1974 disappearance of Lord Lucan following the murder of his family's nanny include, for example, allegations of a suicide plot whereby his body was fed to tigers at Howletts Zoo. Numerous conspiracy theories have also attended the 2007 disappearance of English girl Madeleine McCann.\nThe murder of Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, which runs contrary to US intelligence's conclusion that the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Law enforcement as well as fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org stated that these theories were false and unfounded. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post called the fabrications fake news and falsehoods.\n\n\n== Economics and society ==\n\n\n=== New World Order ===\n\nThe New World Order theory states that a group of international elites control governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies.\nThe New World Order has been connected to a wide range of actors including the Illuminati (see § Illuminati), Jews (§ Antisemitism), colluding world governments or corporations, NGOs such as the World Economic Forum (Great Reset § Conspiracy theories), and secretive organizations such as Bohemian Grove, Le Cercle, and Skull and Bones. Theorists believe that a wide range of musicians, including Beyoncé and Whitney Houston, have been associated with the \"group\". Prominent theorists include Mark Dice and David Icke.\n\n\n=== Predictive programming ===\n\nMany theorists allege that the contents of fictional media, in a process called \"predictive programming\", are manipulated to reference planned false flags, technological innovations, social changes, and other future events. These references are understood to be a conditioning and brainwashing tool, such that the public becomes more accepting of these events than they would be otherwise. Predictive programming has been used to explain events such as the September 11 attacks and COVID-19 pandemic, and has been connected with media such as Die Hard, The Simpsons, and Contagion.\n\n\n=== George Soros ===\n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote many political, social, educational and scientific causes, disbursing grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016. However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world's wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as antifa, which some conspiracy theorists claim is a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by Viktor Orbán, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Bill O'Reilly, Roy Moore, Alex Jones, Paul Gosar, and Ben Garrison. Soros conspiracy theories are sometimes linked to antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\n\n=== Freemasonry ===\nConspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons have proliferated since the 18th century. Theorists have alleged that Freemasons control large parts of the economies or judiciaries of a number of countries, and have alleged Masonic involvement in the British enquiry regarding the sinking of the Titanic and in the crimes of Jack the Ripper. Notable among theorists has been American inventor Samuel Morse, who in 1835 published a book of his own conspiracy theories. Freemason conspiracy theories have also been linked to certain antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\n\n=== Üst akıl ===\nConspiracy theories in Turkey started to dominate public discourse during the late reign of the Justice and Development Party and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 2014, Erdoğan coined the term üst akıl (\"mastermind\") to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the United States, in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey. Erdoğan as well as the Daily Sabah newspaper have on multiple occasions alleged that very different non-state actors—like the Salafi jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the libertarian socialist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and supporters of Fethullah Gülen—were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign.\nOne instance of promoting the \"mastermind\" conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey's economy with an \"artificial earthquake\" near Istanbul. In another example, in November 2017, the Islamist newspaper Yeni Akit claimed that the fashion trend of \"ripped denim\" jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey.\n\n\n== Espionage ==\n\n\n=== Israel animal spying ===\n\nThere are conspiracy theories alleging that Israel uses animals to conduct espionage or to attack people. These are often associated with conspiracy theories about Zionism. Matters of interest to theorists include a series of shark attacks in Egypt in 2010, Hezbollah's accusations of the use of \"spying\" eagles, and the 2011 capture of a griffon vulture carrying an Israeli-labeled satellite tracking device.\n\n\n=== Harold Wilson ===\nNumerous persons, including former MI5 officer Peter Wright and Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, have alleged that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was secretly a KGB spy. Historian Christopher Andrew has lamented that a number of people have been \"seduced by Golitsyn's fantasies\".\n\n\n=== Malala Yousafzai ===\nConspiracy theories concerning Malala Yousafzai are widespread in Pakistan, elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in Dawn. These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the Taliban in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor Robert de Niro disguised as an Uzbek homeopath.\n\n\n== Ethnicity, race and religion ==\n\n\n=== Antisemitism ===\n\nSince at least the Middle Ages, antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory. In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells, had been responsible for the death of Jesus, and ritually consumed the blood of Christians. The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of communism, or the hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1903), which outlines a supposed high council of Jews planning to control the world. Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler. Antisemitic theories persist today concerning banking, Hollywood, the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government of the United States. These theories all allege plots to establish a world tyranny.\nHolocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory, claiming that the Nazi extermination of European Jews is a hoax designed to win sympathy for Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel. Holocaust deniers include Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the chemist with a conviction for inciting racial hatred Germar Rudolf and the discredited author David Irving.\nReptilian conspiracies, prominent in ufology theories, have also been linked to anti-semitism, as \"a very old trope with disturbing links to anti-immigrant and antisemitic hostilities dating to the 19th century.\" Conspiracy author David Icke suggests numerous Jewish political figures are reptilian shapeshifters and \"the Jewish Rothschild family is part of a bloodline of reptilian humanoids that secretly control the world\". Critics contend these theories to be antisemitic, although he denies animosity towards Jewish people. Other far-right ufologists speculate that the Jewish race originated from genetic engineering by malevolent extraterrestrials engaged in interstellar conflict with Anunnaki or Pleiadians.\n\n\n=== Anti-Armenianism ===\n\nConspiracy theories that allege that the Armenians wield secret political power are prevalent in Azerbaijan and have been promoted by the government, including President Ilham Aliyev. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has claimed that the Russian media is run by Armenians. American writer and disbarred lawyer Samuel Weems has claimed that the Armenian genocide was a hoax designed to defraud Christian nations of billions of dollars, and that the Armenian Church instigates terrorist attacks. Filmmaker Davud Imanov has accused the Armenians of plotting against Azerbaijan and has claimed that the Karabakh movement was a plot by the CIA to destroy the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Anti-Baháʼísm ===\n\nIran's Baháʼí Faith minority has been the target of conspiracy theories alleging involvement with hostile powers. Iranian government officials and others have claimed that Baháʼís have been variously agents of the Russian, British, American or Israeli governments. An apocryphal and historically inaccurate book published in Iran, entitled The Memoirs of Count Dolgoruki, details a theory that the Bahá'ís intend to destroy Islam. Such anti-Baháʼí accusations have been dismissed as having no factual foundation.\n\n\n=== Anti-Catholicism ===\n\nSince the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, theories about Catholic conspiracies have taken many forms, including the 17th-century Popish Plot allegations, claims by persons such as William Blackstone that Catholics posed a secret threat to Britain, and numerous writings by authors such as Samuel Morse, Rebecca Reed, Avro Manhattan, Jack Chick and Alberto Rivera. Theorists often claim that the Pope is the Antichrist, accuse Catholics of suppressing evidence incompatible with Church teachings, and describe Catholics as being involved with secret evil rituals, crimes, and other plots.\nIn 1853, the Scottish minister Alexander Hislop published his anti-Catholic pamphlet The Two Babylons, in which he claims that the Catholic Church is secretly a continuation of the pagan religion of ancient Babylon, the product of a millennia-old conspiracy founded by the Biblical king Nimrod and the Assyrian queen Semiramis. It also claims that modern Catholic holidays, including Christmas and Easter, are actually pagan festivals established by Semiramis and that the customs associated with them are pagan rituals. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected the book's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion, but variations of them are still accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants. The Jehovah's Witnesses periodical The Watchtower frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s. The book's thesis has also featured prominently in the conspiracy theories of racist groups, such as The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord.\nFears of a Catholic takeover of the US have been especially persistent, prompted by large-scale Catholic immigration in the 19th century and Ku Klux Klan propaganda. Such fears have attached to Catholic political candidates such as Al Smith and John F. Kennedy. Pope John Paul I died in September 1978, only a month after his election to the papacy. The timing of his death and the Vatican's alleged difficulties with ceremonial and legal death procedures has fostered several conspiracy theories. The elderly Pope Benedict XVI's resignation in February 2013, officially due to \"lack of strength of mind and body\", prompted theories in Italian publications such as La Repubblica and Panorama that he resigned to avoid the exposure of an underground gay Catholic network.\n\n\n=== Antichrist ===\nApocalyptic prophecies, particularly Christian claims about the end times, have inspired a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these cite the Antichrist, a leader who will supposedly create an oppressive world empire. Countless figures have been called Antichrist, including Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Russian emperor Peter the Great, Saladin, Pope John XXII, Benito Mussolini, Barack Obama, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and German Führer Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n=== Bible and Jesus ===\nBible conspiracy theories posit that significant parts of the New Testament are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the Vatican) and fake (such as the Priory of Sion) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the Shroud of Turin. Much of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French draughtsman Pierre Plantard claimed descent. Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. The Gospel of Afranius, an atheistic Russian work published in 1995 with an English translation published in 2022, proposes politically motivated gaslighting as the origin of the foundational Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\n\n\n=== Islamist ===\n\"War against Islam\" is a conspiracy theory in Islamist discourse that describes a plot to destroy Islamic society. The alleged plotters are non-Muslims and \"false Muslims\" in collusion with Western powers whose efforts are a continuation of the Medieval Crusades.\n\n\n=== Anti-Islamic ===\nSince the September 11 Attacks, many anti-Islamic conspiracy theories have emerged. Love Jihad, also called Romeo Jihad, refers to a conspiracy theory that Muslim men try to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by feigning love. The \"Eurabia\" theory alleges a Muslim plot to Islamize Europe and the West through mass immigration and high birth rates. US President Barack Obama was accused of being a secret Muslim.\n\n\n=== Paganism ===\n\nIt's speculated that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an effort to suppress pre-Christian, pagan religions that had endured the Christianization of Europe. Some far right conspiracy theorists suggests that Christianity was created as a Jewish agenda to undermine the Aryan race, which is thought to have initially led to the fall of Rome.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Neo-Pagan Heinrich Himmler organized a branch of the SS to do an extensive survey of witch-hunt trial records across Europe, with the intention to use it as anti-Christian propaganda by claiming the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous Völkisch Norse-Germanic nature religion, and using it as evidence for reconstructing that religion.\n\n\n=== Paul the Apostle ===\nPaul the Apostle makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval Jewish anti-Christian polemic, Toledot Yeshu, as a spy for the rabbis. Muslims have long believed that Paul purposefully corrupted the original revealed teachings of Jesus by introducing elements of paganism, the theology of the cross, and the idea of original sin producing the need for redemption. The Baháʼí Faith also regards Paul as a false or misguided preacher who corrupted Jesus's original message. In this sense, he is seen as the real \"Judas\" who betrayed Jesus.\n\n\n=== Pre-Māori settlement of New Zealand ===\n\n\n=== Racism ===\nWhite genocide conspiracy theory is a white nationalist notion that immigration, integration, low fertility rates and abortion are being promoted in predominantly white countries to dispossess or eliminate white people. A 2017 study in France by IFOP, for example, found that 48% of participants believed that political and media elites are conspiring to replace white people with immigrants.\nThe idea of Black genocide in the United States holds that African Americans are the victims of genocide by white Americans. Arguments for its existence have focused on historical persecution of African Americans through lynchings, racial discrimination, and forced sterilization. Some accusations of genocide have been described as conspiracy theories, in particular the characterization of birth control and medical abortions as part of a deliberate and ongoing genocide of African Americans.\n\"The Plan\" is an alleged plot by white power brokers in Washington, D.C., to take control of the city's local government from African Americans, who were a majority of the city's population from the late 1950s to the early 2010s and remain its largest ethnic group. While most residents, of any race, do not believe in an intentional plan to move or displace black people, many still feel that gentrification, urban renewal projects and the demolition of black neighborhoods have contributed (intentionally or otherwise) to Washington's changing demographics.\n\n\n== Fandom, celebrity relationships, and shipping ==\nNumerous conspiracy theories surround the desire by followers of a fandom for two celebrities to be in a romantic and/or sexual relationship, known as shipping. Many real-person shipping conspiracy theories involve claims that the pregnancies and children of partnered or married celebrity couples are fake. Proponents of celebrity shipping conspiracies that ship two celebrities of the same gender typically argue that they are being pro-LGBT by supporting two people who are forcibly closeted by a homophobic industry.\nConspiracy communities about celebrity relationships tend to be created and dominated by women.\n\n\n=== Larries ===\n\nLarries are a group of shipping conspiracy theorist fans, centered around the idea that two members of the boy band One Direction, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, are secretly a couple. These conspiracy theorists falsely claim that Styles and Tomlinson have been closeted by their management since the inception of the band, despite multiple claims otherwise by Styles, Tomlinson, their friends, and their family.\n\n\n== Government, politics, and conflict ==\n\nIn the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using fake news on social media. A 2017 study of fake news, which was published by the Shorenstein Center, found that \"misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right\". Political conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in Kitchener, Ontario, during World War I, which was believed by some in Kitchener to still be present years after the war ended and to be controlling local politics.\n\n\n=== BlueAnon ===\nBlueAnon is a set of loosely related left-wing conspiracy theories that suggest Donald Trump is engaged in elaborate plots to capture or maintain control of the United States Government.\n\n\n=== Crisis actors ===\n\nCrisis actors are individuals who portray disaster victims in first responder training exercises. Conspiracy theories allege that mass shooting and similar traumatic events are actually staged, with victims and their families being portrayed by covert crisis actors.\n\n\n=== Illuminati in Europe ===\nConspiracy theories concerning the Illuminati, a short-lived 18th-century Enlightenment-era secret society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some Catholic conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the French Revolution of 1789–1799. Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the Discordians who wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to Playboy.\n\n\n=== False flag operations ===\n\nFalse flag operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or are subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 Reichstag arson attack). Unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theories.\nSuch allegations have attached to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Oklahoma City bombing, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, and the Euromaidan massacre. The rise of ISIS gave rise to conspiracy theories that it had been created by the US, CIA, Mossad, or Hillary Clinton. The same happened after the rise of Boko Haram.\n\n\n=== 9/11 2001 attack on United States ===\n\nThe attacks on the US by terrorists using hijacked aircraft on 11 September 2001 have proved attractive to conspiracy theorists. Theories may include reference to missile or hologram technology. The most common theory is that the Twin Towers collapsed in controlled demolitions, a theory rejected by the engineering profession and the 9/11 Commission.\n\n\n=== Sandy Hook school shooting in US 2012 ===\n\nA 2012 fatal mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, prompted numerous conspiracy theories, among them the claim that it was a staged to promote gun control. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke blamed Zionist deception. Theorists such as Alex Jones have suggested that the event was staged with actors. Harassment of the bereaved families by conspiracy theorists has resulted in actions for defamation. Rush Limbaugh stated that the Mayan Calendar phenomenon drove the shooter Adam Lanza.\n\n\n=== Clintons ===\n\nThe Clinton body count conspiracy theory, notably advanced by Newsmax publisher Christopher Ruddy, asserts that US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton have assassinated fifty or more of their associates and enemies. Such accusations have been around at least since the 1990s, when a pseudo-documentary film called The Clinton Chronicles, produced by Larry Nichols and promoted by Rev. Jerry Falwell, accused Bill Clinton of multiple crimes including murder.\n\n\n=== Jeffrey Epstein death conspiracy theories ===\n\nThe 2019 death of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier billionaire and convicted sex offender with ties to Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and other members of the elite, has become the subject of conspiracy theories.\n\n\n=== 2017 Las Vegas shooting conspiracy theories ===\n\nThe 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, has sparked numerous conspiracy theories. Some theorists suggest the use of a machine gun rather than semi-automatic weapons, claiming the rapid fire heard in videos indicates automatic gunfire. Others allege government involvement, speculating that the incident was orchestrated to justify banning bump stocks, devices that enable semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly. Additionally, there are theories about multiple shooters, fueled by eyewitness accounts and video evidence that purportedly show gunfire from different locations. Despite extensive investigations debunking these claims, they continue to circulate in various conspiracy theory communities.\n\n\n=== FEMA ===\n\nThe United States's Federal Emergency Management Agency is the subject of many theories, including that the organization has been building concentration camps in the US to prepare for imposing martial law and genocide.\n\n\n=== African National Congress ===\nMembers of South Africa's African National Congress party have long propagated conspiracy theories, frequently concerning the CIA and alleged white supremacists. In 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe joined others in accusing without evidence Public Protector Thuli Madonsela of being a US agent working to create a puppet government in South Africa.\n\n\n=== Barack Obama ===\n\nBarack Obama has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. His presidency was the subject of a 2009 film, The Obama Deception, by Alex Jones, which alleged that Obama's administration was a puppet government for a wealthy elite. The \"birther\" theory, which came to prominence in 2009, denies the legitimacy of Obama's presidency by claiming that he was not born in the US. This theory has persisted despite his Hawaiian birth certificate and birth announcements in two Hawaiian newspapers in 1961. Notable promoters of the theory are dentist-lawyer Orly Taitz and President Donald Trump, who has since publicly acknowledged its falsity but is said to continue to advocate for it privately. Other theories claim that Obama, a Protestant Christian, is secretly a Muslim.\nA pair of fatal attacks on US government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, by Islamist terrorists in 2012 has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, including allegations that Obama's administration arranged the attack for political reasons, and Senator Rand Paul's claimed that the government's response to the incident was designed to distract from a secret CIA operation.\n\n\n=== Cultural Marxism ===\n\nThe intellectual group known as the Frankfurt School, which emerged in the 1930s, has increasingly been accused of promoting communism in capitalist societies. The term \"Cultural Marxism\" has been notably employed by conservative American movements such as the Tea Party, and by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.\n\n\n=== Deep state ===\n\nWhile the term is occasionally used as a neutral term to denote a nation's bureaucracy, the conspiratorial notion of a \"deep state\" originated principally in Middle Eastern and North African politics with some basis in truth, and has been known in the US since the 1960s. It was revived under the Trump presidency. \"Deep state\" in the latter sense refers to an unidentified insider \"power elite\" who manipulate a nation's politics and government. Proponents have included Canadian author Peter Dale Scott, who has promoted the idea in the US since the 1990s, as well as Breitbart News, Infowars and Donald Trump. A 2017 poll by ABC News and The Washington Post indicated that 48% of Americans believe in the existence of a conspiratorial \"deep state\" in the US.\n\n\n=== Sutherland Springs ===\n\nThe 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting has also been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories. The shooter has been linked to multiple conspiracies, such as identifying him as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton supporter, Bernie Sanders supporter, \"alt-left\" supporter, antifa member, or radical Muslim; or claiming that he carried an antifa flag and told churchgoers: \"This is a communist revolution\". Some reports also falsely claimed that he targeted the church because they were white conservatives.\n\n\n=== Trump, Biden, and Ukraine ===\n\nBeginning in 2017, a sprawling conspiracy theory emerged from 4chan and was spread via right-wing message boards and websites, then via Breitbart and Fox News to then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The conspiracy theory holds both that Ukraine (rather than Russia) had interfered in the 2016 United States elections, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden had intervened to protect a company in which his son Hunter was involved. The New Yorker found that reporting of the conspiracy in the right wing media was initiated by Peter Schweizer, a former Breitbart News contributor and president of The Government Accountability Institute, \"a self-styled corruption watchdog group chaired and funded by conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer\" and founded by Steve Bannon.\n\n\n=== Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory ===\n\nA series of allegations have been made that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden coordinated efforts against anti-corruption investigations in Ukraine into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, on whose Board Hunter Biden sat. Investigations are currently ongoing.\n\n\n=== Michelle Obama ===\nSome conservatives have supported a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that former FLOTUS, Michelle Obama, is secretly transgender, and that her name was originally \"Michael\". Alex Jones has been a vocal supporter of the theory, initially promoting it in 2014 after Joan Rivers made a joke referring to Obama as transgender.\n\n\n=== Ottoman and Turkish reforms, secularism, and statesmen ===\n\nThe belief that the modernist and secularist movements and reforms in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic were Judeo-Masonic conspiracies is dominant among Islamists. Because of their adherence to traditionalist elements and their creation of cults of personality for the Ottoman sultans, Islamists portray anything contrary to Islamic tradition as evil. According to them, the constitutionalist movement ended absolute monarchy, the end of traditional religious institutions, and the introduction of a secular state were the work of Jews, Freemasons, or Dönmes. For example, according to their conspiracy theory, Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a Dönme.\nVarious conspiracy theories against Atatürk have been put forward by Islamist circles who did not support his secularist reforms. Kadir Mısıroğlu, known for his hatred of Atatürk, is behind many conspiracy theories about Atatürk. One of these conspiracy theories is that Anatolia was invaded by the Greeks as a result of Atatürk's agreement with the United Kingdom to overthrow the caliphate. Another conspiracy theory about Atatürk is that he was poisoned to death by the Freemasons due to the closure of Masonic lodges in Turkey in 1935. In 2015, Yeni Şafak claimed that İsmet İnönü was in charge of planning the murder.\nIn 2007, the bestselling book in Turkey was Musa'nın Çocukları: Tayyip ve Emine (The Children of Moses: Tayyip and Emine) by Ergün Poyraz. Poyraz claims that there is an international Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings behind the world, including installing Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as prime minister of Turkey.\n\n\n=== Golden billion threatens Russia ===\nThe golden billion is an idea there is an anti-Russian Western population of approximately one billion seeking to appropriate Russia's natural resources. It is a justification for Russian leader Vladimir Putin's imperial aggression, claiming to be a defense against a far-reaching covert attack. The theory was first advanced under the name A. Kuzmich.\n\n\n=== Voting pencils ===\n\nThe voting pencil conspiracy theory concerns pencils at polling places enabling electoral fraud through erasing legitimate votes. It has been nicknamed \"Pencilgate\" and promoted on Twitter as \"#Pencilgate\" and \"#UsePens\". The conspiracy theory originated in the United Kingdom and was originally promoted by \"Yes\" voters in the unsuccessful 2014 Scottish independence referendum, with supporters of Scottish independence (who usually lean to the left of the political spectrum) claiming that electoral fraud was the reason the referendum failed. However, the theory was later adopted by supporters of the \"Leave\" vote in the successful 2016 Brexit referendum (who usually lean to the right of the political spectrum). The conspiracy theory has since spread to Australia, with right-wing politician Pauline Hanson, a Queensland Senator who is the founder and leader of the One Nation party, promoted the conspiracy theory in the lead-up to the 2022 Australian federal election.\nWhile pencils are provided at polling places in the United Kingdom and Australia, in neither country is it required that they be used. On their website, the Australian Electoral Commission states:\n\n\"While the provision of pencils used to be a legal requirement, since 2020 under Section 206 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the AEC is required to provide an \"implement or method for voters to mark their ballot papers\".\nThe AEC has found from experience that pencils are the most reliable implements for marking ballot papers. Pencils are practical because they don't run out and the polling staff check and sharpen pencils as necessary throughout election day. Pencils can be stored between elections and they work better in tropical areas.\n\nThere is, however, nothing to prevent an elector from marking their ballot paper with a pen if they so wish.\"\nWhile the AEC only conducts federal elections, voters can use either pencil or pen in state, territory and local elections. Pencils are supplied at polling places for federal elections and for state elections in Tasmania and Victoria, while pens are supplied at polling places for state elections in New South Wales and Western Australia. In 2015, the New South Wales Electoral Commission made the decision to replace pencils with pens at polling places due to controversies regarding their usage and at the 2015 state election, pens began being supplied at polling places across the state. Similarly, the Western Australian Electoral Commission has provided pens instead of pencils at polling places since the 2017.\n\n\n=== QAnon ===\n\nQAnon is a far-right American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in 2017. QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\". Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers. Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump. QAnon has direct roots in Pizzagate, an Internet conspiracy theory that appeared one year earlier, but also incorporates elements of many other theories. QAnon has been described as a cult.\n\n\n=== State-sponsored kidnappings of Muslims in Sweden ===\n\nSince December 2021, disinformation has been spread concerning Swedish social services taking Muslim children into care without a legal basis. As a result of the conspiracy theory, two Swedish people were killed in Brussels in 2023.\n\n\n=== Sustainable development ===\nVarious theories have emerged in response to concepts or international agreements relating to sustainable development. These include theories that Agenda 21, a non-binding action plan of the United Nations, is a plot, disguised as an environmental movement, to end individual freedom and establish a one-world government to cut the world population by 85%, and/or to introduce surveillance by the 5G network.\nSimilarly, the Great Reset Initiative is an economic recovery plan drawn up by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that prioritizes sustainable development. It has been the basis for theories that the COVID-19 pandemic will be used, or was even created by a secret group in order to seize control of the global economy.\nThe urban planning concept of 15-minute cities envisages that all of life's necessities (e.g. work, shops, schools, medical centres) should be within a short walk or bike ride from people's homes. This would thereby encourage people to use their cars less and reduce emissions and pollution in neighbourhoods. However, it has been interpreted as a plan to restrict freedom of movement outside of the 15-minute neighbourhood. These theories occasionally overlap with anti-vaccine misinformation, and fears of a world government.\n\n\n== Medicine ==\n\n\n=== Alternative therapy suppression ===\nA 2013 study approved by the University of Chicago suggested that almost half of Americans believe at least one medical conspiracy theory, with 37% believing that the Food and Drug Administration deliberately suppresses 'natural' cures due to influence from the pharmaceutical industry. A prominent proponent of comparable conspiracy theories has been convicted fraudster Kevin Trudeau.\n\n\n=== Artificial diseases ===\n\nScientists have found evidence that HIV was transferred from monkeys to humans in the 1930s. Evidence exists, however, that the KGB deliberately disseminated a notion in the 1980s that it was invented by the CIA. This idea, and similar ideas concerning Ebola, have since been promoted by persons such as actor Steven Seagal, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and former South Africa President Thabo Mbeki. Similar conspiracy theories allege that pharmaceutical companies assist in the creation of conditions and diseases including ADHD, HSV and HPV.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nA number of conspiracy theories have been promoted about the origin and purported motive behind the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its spread. Some claimed that the virus was engineered, that it may have been a Chinese or United States bioweapon, a Jewish plot, part of which is to force mass vaccinations or sterilizations, spread as part of a Muslim conspiracy, a population control scheme, or related to 5G mobile phone networks.\n\n\n=== Fluoridation ===\n\nWater fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay. Although many dental-health organizations support it, some conspiracy theorists claim that it was a way to dispose of industrial waste, or that it exists to obscure a failure to provide dental care to the poor. A further theory promoted by the John Birch Society in the 1960s described fluoridation as a communist plot to weaken the American population.\n\n\n=== Vaccination ===\n\nIt is claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has mounted a cover-up of a causal link between vaccines and autism. The conspiracy theory developed after the publication in Britain in 1998 of a fraudulent paper by discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield. The resulting anti-vaccine movement has been promoted by a number of prominent persons including Rob Schneider, Jim Carrey, former US President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has led to increased rates of infection and death from diseases such as measles and COVID-19 in many countries, including the US, Italy, Germany, Romania and the UK. Vaccine conspiracy theories have been widespread in Nigeria since at least 2003, as well as in Pakistan. Such theories may feature claims that vaccines are part of a secret anti-Islam plot, and have been linked to fatal mass shootings and bombings at vaccine clinics in both countries.\n\n\n== Outer space ==\nScientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio, with some alleging the involvement of director Stanley Kubrick. The Soviet space program has also attracted theories that the government concealed evidence of failed flights. A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of hacker Gary McKinnon, suggests that a secret program of crewed space fleets exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations.\nConspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the Solar System known as Nibiru or Planet X, which is alleged to pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it. Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of The 12th Planet (1976), by Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin, was given its full form by Nancy Lieder, and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and end times theorist David Meade. The notion received renewed attention during the period prior to the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. Other conspiracy theorists in 2017 also predicted Nibiru would appear, including Terral Croft and YouTube pastor Paul Begley.\n\n\n=== Extraterrestrials and UFOs ===\n\nAmong the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed Roswell incident or activity at Area 51. Multiple reports of dead cattle found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s. This phenomenon has spawned theories variously concerning aliens and secret government or military experiments. Prominent among such theorists is Linda Moulton Howe, author of Alien Harvest (1989).\n\nMany conspiracy theories have drawn inspiration from the writings of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin, who declared that the Anunnaki from Sumerian mythology were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. In his 1994 book Humanity's Extraterrestrial Origins: ET Influences on Humankind's Biological and Cultural Evolution, Arthur Horn proposed that the Anunnaki were a race of blood-drinking, shape-shifting alien reptiles. This theory was adapted and elaborated on by British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who maintains that the Bush family, Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, and the British Royal Family, among others, are or were such creatures, or have been under their control. Icke's critics have suggested that 'reptilians' may be seen as an antisemitic code word, a charge he has denied.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\n\nA climate change conspiracy theory typically alleges that the science behind climate change has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons—higher taxation, controls on lifestyle, and more authoritarian government. Former US President Donald Trump, US Senator James Inhofe, British journalist Christopher Booker, and Viscount Christopher Monckton have promoted such theories. Popular author Michael Crichton wrote a novel based on this premise.\n\n\n=== Weather and earthquake control projects ===\nNumerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects. Theories include the debunked assertion that HAARP, a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system. Some theorists have blamed 2005's Hurricane Katrina and 2024's Helene and Milton on HAARP. HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami or the 2013 Saravan earthquake. Some HAARP-related claims refer to mind-control technology. Also, of interest to conspiracy theorists are cloud-seeding technologies. These include a debunked allegation that the British military's Project Cumulus caused the fatal 1952 Lynmouth Flood in Devon, England, \nCalifornia drought manipulation conspiracy theory, and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the 2010 Pakistan floods.\n\n\n=== MKUltra ===\nGenuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques were followed by many conspiracy theories (like Project Monarch), especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project. These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at Jonestown in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.\n\n\n=== Flat Earth ===\n\nFlat Earth theory first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of Pythagoras. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of YouTube videos. Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that it is instead a disc, or a single infinite plane. The conspiracy often implicates NASA. Other claims include that GPS devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.\n\n\n=== RFID chips ===\n\nRadio frequency identification chips (RFID), such as those implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly widely implanted in humans. Former Whitby, England town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist.\n\n\n=== Technology suppression ===\nNumerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies. Such theories may focus on the Vril Society Conspiracy, allegations of the suppression of the electric car by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?), and the Phoebus cartel, set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs. Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of perpetual motion and cold fusion technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors. Promoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray, Eugene Mallove, and convicted American fraudster Stanley Meyer.\n\n\n=== Weaponry ===\nConspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined. Subjects of theories include: the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, a supposed attempt to turn a US Navy warship invisible; the alleged Montauk Project, a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called \"tsunami bomb\", which is alleged to have caused the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nOther theories include Peter Vogel's debunked claim that an accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago was in fact a nuclear detonation, and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station ViVe that the 2010 Haiti earthquake was caused by a secret US \"earthquake weapon\".\n\n\n=== Targeted Individuals ===\n\nConspiracy theorists claim that government agents are utilizing directed-energy weapons and electronic surveillance to harass members of the population. Theorists often cite research into psychotronic weapons, the Cuban Health Attacks, and the Microwave Auditory Effect as proof of their theory. There are over 10,000 people who identify as Targeted Individuals. The \"Targeted Individual\" phenomenon has been featured on episodes of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura and History Channel's In Search of....\n\n\n=== False history ===\n\nSome theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the phantom time hypothesis of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as Pope Sylvester II in order to position themselves at the millennium.\nA comparable theory, new chronology, is associated with Russian theorist Anatoly Fomenko, who holds that history is many centuries shorter than widely believed, numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, all for political ends. Adherents of have included chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.\nAnother claim is that world governments have hidden evidence for an advanced worldwide civilization with access to free energy and partially populated by giants called Tartaria, which was destroyed in the 1800s by a great \"mud flood\" cataclysm, causing its remains to be buried.\n\n\n=== Dead Internet theory ===\n\nThe Dead Internet theory is the belief that the modern Internet is almost entirely populated by bots and procedurally generated content.\n\n\n=== Smartphones listening in on private conversations ===\n\nAccording to the theory, smartphones with microphones listen to private off-line conversations and use the data for targeted ads.\n\n\n=== 5G misinformation ===\n\nConspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have circulated since the 1990s, having historical parallels with 1903-era radiophobia.  With 5G technology deploying in 2019, the same year that  SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) was discovered, multiple conspiracy theories arose linking the two. From that origin, the list of presumed 5G risks expanded to causing cancers, the killing of wildlife, and government & industrial surveillance.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Boxing ===\nBoxing has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second Ali-Liston fight and the first Bradley-Pacquiao fight were fixed.\n\n\n=== Shergar ===\nThe theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse Shergar in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the Mafia, the IRA and Colonel Gaddafi.\n\n\n=== Rigged selection processes ===\nThe \"frozen envelope theory\" suggests that the National Basketball Association rigged its 1985 draft lottery so that Patrick Ewing would join the New York Knicks. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch. A similar \"hot balls theory\", promoted by Scottish football manager David Moyes, suggests that certain balls used in draws for UEFA and AFC competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes.\n\n\n=== 1984 Firecracker 400 ===\nThe 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida, was the first NASCAR race to be attended by a sitting US president, Ronald Reagan, and was driver Richard Petty's 200th and final career victory. Rival driver Cale Yarborough's premature retirement to the pit road has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event.\n\n\n=== Ronaldo and the 1998 FIFA World Cup final ===\nOn the day of the 1998 FIFA World Cup final, Brazilian striker Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by Brazil coach Mário Zagallo shortly before kick off. Ronaldo \"sleepwalked\" through the final, with France winning the game. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations that persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in The Guardian, \"When Ronaldo's health scare was revealed after the match, the situation's unique circumstances lent itself to fabulous conspiracy theories. Here was the world's most famous sportsman, about to take part in the most important match of his career, when he suddenly, inexplicably, fell ill. Was it stress, epilepsy, or had he been drugged?\" Questions also circulated into who made Ronaldo play the game. Zagallo insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company Nike, Brazil's multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice.\n\n\n=== New England Patriots ===\n\nThe New England Patriots have also been involved in numerous conspiracy theories. During their AFC Championship 24–20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, several conspiracy theories spread stating that the referees helped the Patriots advance to Super Bowl LII where they were eventually defeated by the champion Philadelphia Eagles. However, sports analyst Stephen A. Smith stated the Jaguars were not robbed, but that they had no one to blame but themselves for the loss. There were also conspiracy theories regarding the Super Bowl LI matchup between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons stating that the game was rigged while others said the Falcons made questionable play-calls at the end of the game that resulted in them blowing a 28–3 lead.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConspiracy theories in United States politics\nConspiracy theories in the Arab world\nConspiracy theories in Turkey\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAaronovitch, David (2010) [2009].

        "title": "Deep state",
        "wikipedia_content": "A deep state is a type of government made up of potentially unauthorized secret networks of power operating independently of a state's political leadership in pursuit of their own agenda and goals. In popular usage, the term carries overwhelmingly negative connotations and is often associated with conspiracy theories.\n\n\n== Etymology and original usage ==\n\"Deep state\" is a calque of the Turkish word derin devlet (lit. 'deep state'). The modern concept of \"Deep state\" is associated with Turkey, a presumed secret network of military officers and their civilian allies trying to preserve the secular order based on the ideas of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from 1923. There are also opinions that \"Deep state\" and \"Counter-Guerrilla\" were established in Turkey during the Cold War era as parts of Operation Gladio, to sway Turkey more towards NATO, against the threat of the expansion of Soviet communism.\n\n\n== Popular understanding ==\nAfter the 2016 United States presidential election, deep state became much more widely used as a pejorative term with an overwhelmingly negative connotation by both the Donald Trump administration and conservative-leaning media outlets.\n\n\n== Cases ==\n\n\n=== Chechnya ===\nAccording to the journalist Julia Ioffe, the Russian Republic of Chechnya, under the leadership of Ramzan Kadyrov, had become a state within a state by 2015.\n\n\n=== Egypt ===\nIn 2013, author Abdul-Azim Ahmed wrote the deep state was being used to refer to Egyptian military/security networks, particularly the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces after the 2011 Egyptian revolution. They are \"non-democratic leaders within a country\" whose power is \"independent of any political changes that take place\". They are \"often hidden beneath layers of bureaucracy\" and may not be \"in complete control at all times\" but have \"tangible control of key resources (whether human or financial)\". He also wrote: \"The 'deep state' is beginning to become short hand for the embedded anti-democratic power structures within a government, something very few democracies can claim to be free from.\"\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, the Reichsbürger movement is seen as a significant internal threat analogous to the concept of a deep state. This movement consists of far-right extremists who reject the legitimacy of the Federal Republic of Germany, asserting that the German Reich, which existed prior to 1945, continues to exist. Members of this movement refuse to pay taxes, issue their own identification documents, and often engage in pseudo-legal tactics to assert their views.\nIn December 2022, German authorities foiled a coup plot orchestrated by a group influenced by the Reichsbürger movement and QAnon conspiracy theories. The conspirators aimed to overthrow the German government and install a new regime led by Heinrich XIII Prinz Reuss, a minor aristocrat. The plot involved recruiting former military personnel and stockpiling weapons, intending to use force to achieve their goals. The group had mapped out a new government structure and appointed individuals to cabinet-like roles in anticipation of their success. They sought to cooperate with Russia, though there is no evidence that Russia supported or responded positively to their overtures.\n\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is often considered a significant deep state entity due to its substantial economic, political, and military power. The IRGC operates with considerable autonomy from the elected government and has been involved in various covert operations and influence campaigns. This includes control over significant economic sectors, involvement in foreign military activities, and influence over domestic policy decisions. The IRGC's pervasive influence is seen as a central component of Iran's deep state, shaping both internal and external politics in alignment with its agenda.\n\n\n=== Israel ===\nIn May 2020, an article in Haaretz describes how people meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"have heard lengthy speeches [...] that even though he has been elected repeatedly, in reality, the country is controlled by a 'deep state.'\"\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nIn India, National Advisory Council (NAC) was an advisory body set up by the first United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2004 to advise the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh. Sonia Gandhi served as its chairperson for much of the tenure of the UPA. Its aim was to assist the Prime Minister in achieving and monitoring missions and goals.\nThe concept of a NAC has been criticized by opposition parties and some scholars as not being in keeping with India's constitution, describing it as an alternative cabinet. The NAC was also accused of exercising an outsized influence over the central government.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nThe most famous case is Propaganda Due. Propaganda Due (better known as P2) was a Masonic lodge belonging to the Grand Orient of Italy (GOI). It was founded in 1877 with the name of Masonic Propaganda, in the period of its management by the entrepreneur Licio Gelli it assumed deviated forms with respect to the statutes of the Freemasonry and became subversive towards the Italian legal order. The P2 was suspended by the GOI on 26 July 1976; subsequently, the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the P2 Masonic lodge under the presidency of Minister Tina Anselmi concluded the P2 case by denouncing the lodge as a real \"criminal organization\" and \"subversive\". It was dissolved with a special law, the n. 17 of 25 January 1982.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\nJapan's \"deep state\" can be traced back to pre-World War II times, with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Kwantung Army wielding significant influence over the state. Post-war, elements of this influence continued through organized crime groups like the Yakuza, which have maintained a shadowy presence in Japan's political and economic spheres.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\nRobert Worth argues deep state is \"just as apt\" for networks in many states in the Middle East where governments have colluded with smugglers and jihadis (Syria), jihadi veterans of the Soviet–Afghan War (Yemen), and other criminals working as irregular forces (Egypt and Algeria). In his book From Deep State to Islamic State, he describes a hard core of regimes in Syria, Egypt, and Yemen that staged successful counter-revolutions against the Arab Spring in those countries, comparing them with the Mamluks of Egypt and the Levant 1250–1517 in that they proclaim themselves servants of the putative rulers while actually ruling themselves.\n\n\n=== Pakistan ===\n\nSince independence, the Pakistan Armed Forces have always had a huge influence in the country's politics as a national security institutions. In addition to the decades of direct rule by the military government, the military also has many constraints on the power of the elected prime ministers, and also has been accused of being a deep state. The Pakistan Army is often referred to as \"The Establishment\" due to its deep involvement in the country's decision-making processes specifically the foreign affairs.\n\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nAccording to the Journalist Robert F. Worth, \"The expression 'deep state' had originated in Turkey in the 1990s, where the military colluded with drug traffickers and hit men to wage a dirty war against Kurdish insurgents\". Professor Ryan Gingeras wrote that the Turkish term derin devlet \"colloquially speaking\" refers to \"'criminal' or 'rogue' elements that have somehow muscled their way into power\". The journalist Dexter Filkins wrote of a \"presumed clandestine network\" of Turkish \"military officers and their civilian allies\" who, for decades, \"suppressed and sometimes murdered dissidents, Communists, reporters, Islamists, Christian missionaries, and members of minority groups—anyone thought to pose a threat to the secular order\". Journalist Hugh Roberts has described the \"shady nexus\" between the police and intelligence services, \"certain politicians and organised crime\", whose members believe they are authorised \"to get up to all sorts of unavowable things\" because they are \"custodians of the higher interests of the nation\".\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe Civil Service has been called a deep state by senior politicians. In 2018, Steve Hilton, then advisor to David Cameron, claimed Tony Blair had said: \"You cannot underestimate how much they believe it's their job to actually run the country and to resist the changes put forward by people they dismiss as 'here today, gone tomorrow' politicians. They genuinely see themselves as the true guardians of the national interest, and think that their job is simply to wear you down and wait you out.\" The British comedy series Yes Minister paints the conflict of the civil servant and the politician in charge in a humoristic way.\nIn February 2024, former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss claimed that she was forced out of office by the 'deep state' during an appearance at that year's Conservative Political Action Conference in the US. This statement was criticised within her own party and by the opposition, with both Labour Party Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth and the Liberal Democrats Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper referring to it as a \"conspiracy theory\".\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nSince at least 1963, the deep state has been used to describe \"a hybrid association of government elements and parts of top-level industry and finance that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.\" Intelligence agencies such as the CIA have been accused by elements of the Donald Trump administration of attempting to thwart its policy goals. Writing for The New York Times, the analyst Issandr El Amani warned against the \"growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file\", while analysts of the column The Interpreter wrote:\n\nThough the deep state is sometimes discussed as a shadowy conspiracy, it helps to think of it instead as a political conflict between a nation's leader and its governing institutions.\nAccording to the political commentator David Gergen, quoted by Time in early 2017, the term had been appropriated by Steve Bannon, Breitbart News, and other supporters of the Trump administration in order to delegitimize critics of the Trump presidency. In February 2017, the deep state theory was dismissed by authors for The New York Times, as well as The New York Observer. In October 2019 The New York Times gave credence to the general idea by publishing an opinion piece arguing that the deep state in the Civil Service was created to \"battle people like Trump\". Trump's warnings about a deep state have been referred to as \"repeating a longtime [John Birch Society] talking point\".\nScholars have generally disputed the notion that the U.S. Executive Branch bureaucracy represents a true deep state as the term is formally understood but have taken a range of views on the role of that bureaucracy in constraining or empowering the U.S. president.\n\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n\nThe Cartel of the Suns, a group of high-ranking officials within the Bolivarian government of Venezuela, has been described as \"a series of often competing networks buried deep within the Chavista regime\". Following the Bolivarian Revolution, the Bolivarian government initially embezzled until there were no more funds to embezzle, which required them to turn to drug trafficking. President Hugo Chávez made partnerships with the Colombian leftist militia Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and his successor Nicolás Maduro continued the process, promoting officials to high-ranking positions after they were accused of drug trafficking.\n\n\n=== Other alleged cases ===\nImperial Brazil's Diretório Monárquico do Brasil and Black Guard\nImperial Japan's Army, Kwantung Army and the post-war Yakuza\nIndia's Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\nIndonesia's Kopassus\nKingdom of Serbia's Black Hand\nMorocco's Makhzen\nNetherlands’ Student Societies\nPakistan's Intelligence Community: ISI, FIA, NAB, and/or IB\nSerbia and Montenegro's RDB\nSpain's Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación, \"Antiterrorist Liberation Groups\"\nThailand's Military-Monarchy Nexus or Network Monarchy\nUnited Kingdom's City of London Corporation\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "New World Order conspiracy theory",
        "wikipedia_content": "The New World Order (NWO) is a term used in several conspiracy theories which hypothesize a secretly emerging totalitarian world government. The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian one-world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been alleged to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.\nBefore the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right, and secondarily the part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the eschatological end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Academics who study conspiracy theories and religious extremism, such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet, observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order not only had been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but also had seeped into popular culture, thereby fueling a surge of interest and participation in survivalism and paramilitarism as many people actively prepare for apocalyptic and millenarian scenarios. These political scientists warn that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.\n\n\n== History of the term ==\n\n\n=== General usage (pre-Cold War) ===\nDuring the 20th century, political figures such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill used the term \"new world order\" to refer to a new period of history characterized by a dramatic change in world political thought and in the global balance of power after World War I and World War II. The interwar and post-World War II period were seen as opportunities to implement idealistic proposals for global governance by collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to resolve, while nevertheless respecting the right of nations to self-determination. Such collective initiatives manifested in the formation of intergovernmental organizations such as the League of Nations in 1920, the United Nations (UN) in 1945, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, along with international regimes such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), implemented to maintain a cooperative balance of power and facilitate reconciliation between nations to prevent the prospect of another global conflict. These cosmopolitan efforts to instill liberal internationalism were regularly criticized and opposed by American paleoconservative business nationalists from the 1930s on.\nProgressives welcomed international organizations and regimes such as the United Nations in the aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued that these initiatives suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another world war, but also to foster global justice, as the UN was chartered to be a free association of sovereign nation-states rather than a transition to democratic world government. Thus, cosmopolitan activists around the globe, perceiving the IGOs as too ineffectual for global change, formed a world federalist movement.\nBritish writer and futurist H. G. Wells went further than progressives in the 1940s, by appropriating and redefining the term \"new world order\" as a synonym for the establishment of a technocratic world state and of a planned economy, garnering popularity in state socialist circles.\n\n\n=== Usage as reference to a conspiracy (Cold War era) ===\nDuring the Second Red Scare, both secular and Christian right American agitators, largely influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr, increasingly embraced and spread dubious fears of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jews as the alleged driving forces behind an \"international communist conspiracy\". The threat of \"Godless communism\", in the form of an atheistic, bureaucratic collectivist world government, demonized as the \"Red Menace\", became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism. The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is that liberals and progressives, with their welfare-state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid, supposedly contribute to a gradual process of global collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communistic/collectivist one-world government. James Warburg, appearing before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1950, famously stated: \"We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest.\"\nRight-wing populist advocacy groups with a paleoconservative world-view, such as the John Birch Society, disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the Soviet Union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists, \"greedy\" bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the UN as the vehicle to create a \"One World Government\". This anti-globalist conspiracism fueled the campaign for U.S. withdrawal from the UN. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her booklet The Profound Revolution (1966), traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the establishment of the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1913 by international bankers, whom she claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as a shadow government. At the time the booklet was published, many readers would have interpreted \"international bankers\" as a reference to a postulated \"international Jewish banking conspiracy\" masterminded by the Rothschild family.\nArguing that the term \"New World Order\" is used by a secretive global elite dedicated to the eradication of the sovereignty of the world's nations, American writer Gary Allen—in his books None Dare Call It Conspiracy (1971), Rockefeller: Campaigning for the New World Order (1974), and Say \"No!\" to the New World Order (1987)—articulated the anti-globalist theme of contemporary right-wing conspiracism in the U.S. After the fall of communism in the early 1990s, the de facto subject of New World Order conspiracism shifted from crypto-communists, perceived to be plotting to establish an atheistic world communist government, to globalists, perceived to be plotting to implement a collectivist generally, unified world government ultimately controlled by an untouchable oligarchy of international bankers, corrupt politicians, and corporatists, or the United Nations itself. The shift in perception was inspired by growing opposition to corporate internationalism on the American right in the 1990s.\nIn his speech, Toward a New World Order, delivered on 11 September 1990 during a joint session of the US Congress, President George H. W. Bush described his objectives for post-Cold War global governance in cooperation with post-Soviet states. He stated:\n\nUntil now, the world we've known has been a world divided—a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict, and the cold war. Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the genuine prospect of new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a \"world order\" in which \"the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ...\" A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.\nThe New York Times observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization of American imperial ambitions in the Middle East at the time. At the same time conservatives rejected any new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of a UN revival. Chip Berlet, an American investigative reporter specializing in the study of right-wing movements in the US, wrote that the Christian and secular far-right were especially terrified by Bush's speech. Fundamentalist Christian groups interpreted Bush's words as signaling the End Times. At the same time, more secular theorists approached it from an anti-communist and anti-collectivist standpoint and feared for hegemony over all countries by the United Nations.\n\n\n=== Post-Cold War usage ===\n\nAmerican televangelist Pat Robertson, with his best-selling book The New World Order (1991), became the most prominent Christian disseminator of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, constantly nudging people covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist.\nIt has been observed that, throughout the 1990s, the galvanizing language used by conspiracy theorists such as Linda Thompson, Mark Koernke and Robert K. Spear led to militancy and the rise of the American militia movement. The militia movement's anti-government ideology was spread through speeches at rallies and meetings, books and videotapes sold at gun shows, shortwave and satellite radio, fax networks, and computer bulletin boards. It has been argued that it was overnight AM radio shows and propagandistic viral content on the internet that most effectively contributed to more extremist responses to the perceived threat of the New World Order. This led to the substantial growth of New World Order conspiracism, with it retroactively finding its way into the previously apolitical literature of numerous Kennedy assassinologists, ufologists, lost land theorists and—partially inspired by fears surrounding the \"Satanic panic\"—occultists. From the mid-1990s onward, the amorphous appeal of those subcultures transmitted New World Order conspiracism to a larger audience of seekers of stigmatized knowledge, with the common characteristic of disillusionment of political efficacy.\nFrom the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, Hollywood conspiracy-thriller television shows and films also played a role in introducing a general audience to various fringe, esoteric theories related to New World Order conspiracism—which by that point had developed to include black helicopters, FEMA \"concentration camps\", etc.—theories which for decades previously were confined to largely right-wing subcultures. The 1993–2002 television series The X-Files, the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory and the 1998 film The X-Files: Fight the Future are often cited as notable examples. \nFollowing the start of the 21st century, and specifically during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown and Henry Kissinger, used the term \"new world order\" in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of the global financial system and their calls for a \"New Bretton Woods\" taking into account emerging markets such as China and India. These public declarations reinvigorated New World Order conspiracism, culminating in talk-show host Sean Hannity stating on his Fox News program Hannity that the \"conspiracy theorists were right\". Progressive media-watchdog groups have repeatedly criticized Fox News in general, and its now-defunct opinion show Glenn Beck in particular, for not only disseminating New World Order conspiracy theories to mainstream audiences, but possibly agitating so-called \"lone wolf\" extremism, particularly from the radical right.\nIn 2009, American film directors Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists—such as American radio host Alex Jones—who vigorously oppose what they perceive as an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing agitators and hip hop music's left-wing rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\nThere are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed. The following is a list of the major ones in roughly chronological order:\n\n\n=== End time ===\n\nSince the 19th century, many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists, starting with John Nelson Darby, have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the \"end time\" in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Daniel, the Olivet Discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels, 2 Esdras 11:32 and Revelation 13:7. They claim that people who have made a deal with the Devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic-messianic world religion, which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an \"Unholy Trinity\" of Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet. In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will be either the last pope of the Catholic Church (groomed and installed by an Alta Vendita or Jesuit conspiracy), a guru from the New Age movement, or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist Christian organization like the Fellowship, while the Antichrist will be either the President of the European Union, the Caliph of a pan-Islamic state, or even the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nSome of the most vocal critics of end-time conspiracy theories come from within Christianity. In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal, when reviewing Robertson's 1991 book The New World Order. Another critique can be found in historian Gregory S. Camp's 1997 book Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia. Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that \"New World Order\" rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the \"New World Order\" as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever.  Furthermore, he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally anti-Christian, because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message about the coming kingdom of God into one of fear, panic and despair in the face of an allegedly approaching one-world government. Progressive Christians, such as preacher-theologian Peter J. Gomes, caution Christian fundamentalists that a \"spirit of fear\" can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism, apocalyptic timetables, demonization and oppressive prejudices, while Camp warns of the \"very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage\" by credulously embracing conspiracy theories. They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent.\n\n\n=== Freemasonry ===\n\nFreemasonry is one of the world's oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose in Great Britain during the 18th century.  Over the years, several allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry, including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order, a world government organized according to Masonic principles or governed only by Freemasons.\nThe esoteric nature of Masonic symbolism and rites led to Freemasons first being accused of secretly practicing Satanism in the late 18th century. The original allegation of a conspiracy within Freemasonry to subvert religions and governments to take over the world traces back to Scottish author John Robison, whose reactionary conspiracy theories crossed the Atlantic and influenced outbreaks of Protestant anti-Masonry in the United States during the 19th century.  In the 1890s, French writer Léo Taxil wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing Freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshiping Lucifer as the Supreme Being and Great Architect of the Universe. Despite the fact that Taxil admitted that his claims were all a hoax, they were and still are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists and had a huge influence on subsequent anti-Masonic claims about Freemasonry.\nSome conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some Founding Fathers of the United States, such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, were having Masonic sacred geometric designs interwoven into American society, particularly in the Great Seal of the United States, the United States one-dollar bill, the architecture of National Mall landmarks and the streets and highways of Washington, D.C., as part of a master plan to create the first \"Masonic government\" as a model for the coming New World Order.\n\nFreemasons rebut these claims of a Masonic conspiracy. Freemasonry, which promotes rationalism, places no power in occult symbols themselves, and it is not a part of its principles to view the drawing of symbols, no matter how large, as an act of consolidating or controlling power. Furthermore, there is no published information establishing the Masonic membership of the men responsible for the design of the Great Seal. While conspiracy theorists assert that there are elements of Masonic influence on the Great Seal of the United States and that these elements were intentionally or unintentionally used because the creators were familiar with the symbols, in fact, the all-seeing Eye of Providence and the unfinished pyramid were symbols used as much outside Masonic lodges as within them in the late 18th century. Therefore, the designers were drawing from common esoteric symbols. The Latin phrase \"novus ordo seclorum\", appearing on the reverse side of the Great Seal since 1782 and the back of the one-dollar bill since 1935, translates to \"New Order of the Ages\", and alludes to the beginning of an era where the United States of America is an independent nation-state; conspiracy theorists often mistranslate it as \"New World Order\".\nAlthough the European continental branch of Freemasonry has organizations that allow political discussion within their Masonic Lodges, Masonic researcher Trevor W. McKeown argues that the accusations ignore several facts. Firstly, the many Grand Lodges are independent and sovereign, meaning they act independently and do not have a common agenda. The points of belief of the various lodges often differ. Secondly, famous Freemasons have always held views that span the political spectrum and show no particular pattern or preference. As such, the term \"Masonic government\" is erroneous; there is no consensus among Freemasons about what an ideal government would look like.\n\n\n=== Illuminati ===\n\nThe Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age secret society founded by university professor Adam Weishaupt on 1 May 1776, in Upper Bavaria, Germany. The movement consisted of advocates of freethought, secularism, liberalism, republicanism, and gender equality, recruited from the German Masonic Lodges, who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools. In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up, and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion, Roman Catholicism. There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.\nIn the late 18th century, reactionary conspiracy theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression and become the masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe and the rest of the world by spreading the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism— which the accusers feared would lead to the destruction of the natural order of things. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent.\nDuring the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government. The Illuminatus! Trilogy, a series of three satirical novels by American writers Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, first published in 1975, which attributed the alleged major cover-ups of the era – such as who shot John F. Kennedy – to the Illuminati, was extremely influential in popularizing the myth of an Illuminati superconspiracy during the 1960s and onward.\n\n\n=== The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ===\nThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, originally published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.\n\nNumerous polemicists, such as Irish journalist Philip Graves in a 1921 article in The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols to be both a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, as a work of counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly.\nResponsible for feeding many antisemitic and anti-Masonic mass hysteria of the twentieth century, The Protocols has been influential in the development of some conspiracy theories, including some New World Order theories, and repeatedly appears in certain contemporary conspiracy literature. For example, the authors of the 1982 controversial book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail concluded that The Protocols was the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion. They speculated that this secret society was working behind the scenes to establish a theocratic \"United States of Europe\". Politically and religiously unified through the imperial cult of a Merovingian Great Monarch—supposedly descended from a Jesus bloodline—who occupies both the throne of Europe and the Holy See, this \"Holy European Empire\" would become the hyperpower of the 21st century. Although the Priory of Sion itself has been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as a hoax, some apocalyptic millenarian Christian eschatologists who believe The Protocols is authentic became convinced that the Priory of Sion was a fulfillment of prophecies found in the Book of Revelation and further proof of an anti-Christian conspiracy of epic proportions signaling the imminence of a New World Order.\nSkeptics argue that the current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they \"really\" come from some group other than the Jews, such as fallen angels or alien invaders.  Although it is hard to determine whether the conspiracy-minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it does not make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged, giving The Protocols credibility and circulation.\n\n\n=== Round table ===\nDuring the second half of Britain's \"imperial century\" between 1815 and 1914, English-born South African businessman, mining magnate, and politician Cecil Rhodes advocated the British Empire reannexing the United States of America and reforming itself into an \"Imperial Federation\" to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace. In his first will, written in 1877 at the age of 23, he expressed his wish to fund a secret society (known as the Society of the Elect) that would advance this goal:\n\nTo and for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley of the Euphrates, the Islands of Cyprus and Candia [Crete], the whole of South America, the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain, the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to render wars impossible, and promote the best interests of humanity.\n\nIn 1890, thirteen years after \"his now-famous will,\" Rhodes elaborated on the same idea: establishment of \"England everywhere,\" which would \"ultimately lead to the cessation of all wars, and one language throughout the world.\" \"The only thing feasible to carry out this idea is a secret society gradually absorbing the wealth of the world [\"and human minds of the higher-order\"] to be devoted to such an object.\"\nRhodes also concentrated on the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British statesman Alfred Milner as one of its trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the great powers by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the University of Oxford.\nMilner and British official Lionel George Curtis were the architects of the Round Table movement, a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949, but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner, and Curtis.\nThe Council on Foreign Relations began in 1917 with a group of New York academics who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers, and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council's projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe, and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.\nIn the 1960s, right-wing populist individuals and groups with a paleoconservative worldview, such as members of the John Birch Society, were the first to combine and spread a business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as front organizations for the Round Table of the \"Anglo-American Establishment\", which are financed by an \"international banking cabal\" that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an oligarchic new world order through a global financial system. Anti-globalist conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for International Settlements.\nThe research findings of historian Carroll Quigley, author of the 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W. Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.\nLarry McDonald, the second president of the John Birch Society and a conservative Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives who represented the 7th congressional district of Georgia, wrote a foreword for Allen's 1976 book The Rockefeller File, wherein he claimed that the Rockefellers and their allies were driven by a desire to create a one-world government that combined \"super-capitalism\" with communism and would be fully under their control. He saw a conspiracy plot that was \"international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.\"\nIn his 2002 autobiography Memoirs, David Rockefeller wrote:\n\nFor more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents ... to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\nBarkun argues that this statement is partly facetious (the claim of \"conspiracy\" and \"treason\") and partly serious—the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan; for example — an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the internationalist wing of the Republican Party (known as \"Rockefeller Republicans\" in honor of Nelson Rockefeller) when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order in the form of a one-world government.\nIn a 13 November 2007 interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford, Rockefeller countered that he felt no need for a world government and wished for the world's governments to work together and collaborate. He also stated that it seemed neither likely nor desirable to have only one elected government rule worldwide. He criticized accusations of him being \"ruler of the world\" as nonsensical.\nSome American social critics, such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an \"imperial brain trust\" which has, for decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-World War II international order and the Cold War by determining what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table; others, such as G. William Domhoff, argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum which provides the business input to U.S. foreign policy planning. Domhoff argues that \"[i]t has nearly 3,000 members, far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group. All the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates, and speakers. As far as being secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives.\" However, all these critics agree that \"[h]istorical studies of the CFR show that it has a very different role in the overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists.\"\n\n\n=== The Open Conspiracy ===\n\nIn his 1928 book The Open Conspiracy British writer and futurist H. G. Wells promoted cosmopolitanism and offered blueprints for a world revolution and World Brain to establish a technocratic world state and planned economy. Wells warned, however, in his 1940 book The New World Order that:\n\n... when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people ... will hate the new world order, be rendered unhappy by the frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.\nWells's books were influential in giving a second meaning to the term \"new world order\", which would only be used by state socialist supporters and anti-communist opponents. However, despite the popularity and notoriety of his ideas, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to intelligentsias who would, ultimately, have to coordinate the Wellsian new world order.\n\n\n=== New Age ===\nBritish neo-Theosophical occultist Alice Bailey, one of the founders of the so-called New Age movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the Allies of World War II over the Axis powers (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order. She saw a federal world government as the culmination of Wells' Open Conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be synarchist because it was guided by the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, intent on preparing humanity for the mystical second coming of Christ, and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the Great White Brotherhood works on the \"inner planes\" to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this Spiritual Hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists, with whom they communicate telepathically, but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an \"Externalization of the Hierarchy\" and everyone will know of their presence on Earth.\n\nBailey's writings, along with American writer Marilyn Ferguson's 1980 book The Aquarian Conspiracy, contributed to conspiracy theorists of the Christian right viewing the New Age movement as the \"false religion\" that would supersede Christianity in a New World Order. Skeptics argue that the term \"New Age movement\" is a misnomer, generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch-all rubric for any new religious movement that is not fundamentalist Christian. By this logic, anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully anti-Christian.\nParadoxically, since the first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order to take advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.\nSkeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.\n\n\n=== Fourth Reich ===\n\nConspiracy theorists often use the term \"Fourth Reich\" simply as a pejorative synonym for the \"New World Order\" to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany's Third Reich.\nConspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, claim that some ex-Nazis, who survived the fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by organizations like ODESSA and Die Spinne, has been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.\nThis neo-Nazi conspiracy is said to be animated by an \"Iron Dream\" in which the American Empire, having thwarted the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy and overthrown its Zionist Occupation Government, gradually establishes a Fourth Reich formerly known as the \"Western Imperium\"—a pan-Aryan world empire modeled after Adolf Hitler's New Order—which reverses the \"decline of the West\" and ushers a golden age of white supremacy.\nSkeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate the influence of ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad have a long history in the United States that predates the 20th century. Political theorist Sheldon Wolin has expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.\n\n\n=== Alien invasion ===\nSince the late 1970s, extraterrestrials from other habitable planets or parallel dimensions (such as \"Greys\") and intraterrestrials from Hollow Earth (such as \"Reptilians\") have been included in the New World Order conspiracy, in more or less dominant roles, as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and Milton William Cooper, and British writer David Icke.\n\nThe common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades, centuries or millennia. Still, a government cover-up enforced by \"Men in black\" has shielded the public from knowledge of a secret alien invasion. Motivated by speciesism and imperialism, these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in human society to more efficiently control and exploit human beings. In some theories, alien infiltrators have shapeshifted into human form and move freely throughout human society, even to the point of taking control of command positions in governmental, corporate, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the world. A mythical covert government agency of the United States code-named Majestic 12 is often imagined being the shadow government which collaborates with the alien occupation and permits alien abductions, in exchange for assistance in the development and testing of military \"flying saucers\" at Area 51, for United States armed forces to achieve full-spectrum dominance.\nThose who adhere to the psychosocial hypothesis for unidentified flying objects argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory is a product of not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.\n\n\n=== Brave New World ===\n\nAntiscience and neo-Luddite conspiracy theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They speculate that the global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist plan to develop and use human enhancement technologies to become a \"posthuman ruling caste\", while change accelerates toward a technological singularity—a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World-like dystopia—a \"Brave New World Order\"—or the extinction of the human species.\nDemocratic transhumanists, such as American sociologist James Hughes, counter that many influential members of the United States establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as demonstrated by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.\n\n\n== Postulated implementations ==\nJust as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order, so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it:\n\n\n=== Gradualism ===\nConspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the Euro in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002, and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.\nAn increasingly popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists is that the hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, will be the next milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites is planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada, and the United States are in the process of being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa, and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.\nSkeptics argue that the North American Union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic, and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. However, some of these papers become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and form the basis of all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears, especially during times of economic anxiety.\nFor example, in March 2009, as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special drawing rights. Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.\nJudging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing global problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.\n\n\n=== Coup d'état ===\n\nAmerican right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, especially those who joined the militia movement in the United States, speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic coup d'état by a \"secret team\", using black helicopters, in the U.S. and other nation-states to bring about a totalitarian world government controlled by the United Nations and enforced by troops of foreign U.N. peacekeepers. Following the Rex 84 and Operation Garden Plot plans, this military coup would involve the suspension of the Constitution, the imposition of martial law, and the appointment of military commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents.\nThese conspiracy theorists, who are all strong believers in a right to keep and bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolition of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.\nBefore 2000, some survivalists believed this process would be set in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the 11 September attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 to complete the transition to a police state.\nSkeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban, military coup, internment, or U.N. invasion and occupation are rooted in the siege mentality of the American militia movement but also an apocalyptic millenarianism which provides a basic narrative within the political right in the U.S., claiming that the idealized society (i.e., constitutional republic, Jeffersonian democracy, \"Christian nation\", \"white nation\") is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of liberal secular humanists who want \"Big Government\" and globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order.\n\n\n=== Mass surveillance ===\nConspiracy theorists concerned with surveillance abuse believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence at the core of the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.\nClaiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now make it possible to require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.\nIn January 2002, the Information Awareness Office (IAO) was established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying information technology to counter asymmetric threats to national security. Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by the United States Congress in 2003. The second source of controversy involved IAO's original logo, which depicted the \"all-seeing\" Eye of Providence atop of a pyramid looking down over the globe, accompanied by the Latin phrase scientia est potentia (knowledge is power). Although DARPA eventually removed the logo from its website, it left a lasting impression on privacy advocates. It also inflamed conspiracy theorists, who misinterpret the \"eye and pyramid\" as the Masonic symbol of the Illuminati, an 18th-century secret society they speculate continues to exist and is plotting on behalf of a New World Order.\nAmerican historian Richard Landes, who specialized in the history of apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians. Even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes, and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance and the rise of the surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.\n\n\n=== Occultism ===\nConspiracy theorists of the Christian right, starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster, believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy—started by the first mystagogues of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors, such as the Kabbalists, Cathars, Knights Templar, Hermeticists, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and, ultimately, the Illuminati—which seeks to subvert the Judeo-Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist. More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: unknown superiors, spiritual hierarchies, demons, fallen angels or Lucifer. They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences (numerology), symbols (Eye of Providence), rituals (Masonic degrees), monuments (National Mall landmarks), buildings (Manitoba Legislative Building) and facilities (Denver International Airport) to advance their plot to rule the world.\nFor example, in June 1979, an unknown benefactor under the pseudonym \"R. C. Christian\" had a huge granite megalith built in the U.S. state of Georgia, which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the destroyed one. The \"Georgia Guidestones\" has subsequently become a spiritual and political Rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and neo-pagans revere it as a ley-line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian \"Ten Commandments.\" Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer's original intention.\nSkeptics argue that the demonization of Western esotericism by conspiracy theorists is rooted in religious intolerance but also in the same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in the Early Modern period, and satanic ritual abuse allegations in the United States.\n\n\n=== Population control ===\nConspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through human population control to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals. The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs, which promote abstinence, contraception and abortion, or intentionally reducing the bulk of the world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars, through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines, and through environmental disasters by controlling the weather (HAARP, chemtrails), etc. Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are neo-Malthusians who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government. United Nations Agenda 21 is condemned as \"reconcentrating\" people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones, even generating a dystopian novel by Glenn Beck where single-family homes are a distant memory.\nSkeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to the traumatic legacy of the eugenics movement's \"war against the weak\" in the United States during the first decades of the 20th century but also the Second Red Scare in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, when activists on the far right of American politics routinely opposed public health programs, notably water fluoridation, mass vaccination and mental health services, by asserting they were all part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the United Nations and its programs; the introduction of social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the social structure of the U.S. Opposition towards mass vaccinations in particular got significant attention in the late 2010s, so much so the World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019. By this time, people that refused or refused to allow their children to be vaccinated were known colloquially as \"anti-vaxxers\", though citing the New World Order conspiracy theory or resistance to a perceived population control plan as a reason to refuse vaccination were few and far between.\n\n\n=== Mind control ===\nSocial critics accuse governments, corporations, and the mass media of being involved in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of their own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, \"Project Monarch\") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, \"Silent Sound Spread Spectrum\", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.\nSkeptics argue that the paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with mind control, population control, occultism, surveillance abuse, Big Business, Big Government, and globalization arises from a combination of two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong individualist values and 2) lacks power. The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life. One gets what some psychologists call \"agency panic,\" intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.\n\n\n== Alleged conspirators ==\nAccording to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small, secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past, the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.\nAlthough skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making, that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel, and communication—rules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance, and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, but they also move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.\nViewing the history of the world as the history of warfare between secret societies, conspiracy theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global power elite, by claiming that established upper-class families with \"old money\" who founded and finance the Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Club, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes Trust, Skull and Bones, Trilateral Commission, and similar think tanks and private clubs, are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order—the implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank, which maintains political power through the financialization of the economy, regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership, mass surveillance, widespread use of state terrorism, and an all-encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and ideologizes world government as the culmination of history's progress.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nSkeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.\nMarxists, who are skeptical of right-wing populist conspiracy theories, also accuse the global power elite of not having the best interests of all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of international socialism. Arguing that the world is in the middle of a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see that what they demonize as the \"New World Order\" is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.\nDomhoff, a professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of power, wrote in 2005 an essay entitled There Are No Conspiracies. He says that for this theory to be true, it required several \"wealthy and highly educated people\" to do things that don't \"fit with what we know about power structures\". Claims that this will happen go back decades and have always been proved wrong.\nPartridge, a contributing editor to the global affairs magazine Diplomatic Courier, wrote a 2008 article entitled One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future? He says that if anything, nationalism, which is the opposite of a global government, is rising. He also says that attempts at creating global governments or global agreements \"have been categorical failures\".\nAlthough some cultural critics see superconspiracy theories about a New World Order as \"postmodern metanarratives\" that may be politically empowering, a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them, skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism, convoluted thinking, and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce the alleged conspirators.\nAlexander Zaitchik from the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote a report titled \"'Patriot' Paranoia: A Look at the Top Ten Conspiracy Theories\", in which he personally condemns such conspiracies as an effort of the radical right to undermine society.\nConcerned that the improvisational millennialism of most conspiracy theories about a New World Order might motivate lone wolves to engage in leaderless resistance leading to domestic terrorist incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing, Barkun writes that  \"the danger lies less in such beliefs themselves ... than in the behavior they might stimulate or justify\" and warns \"should they believe that the prophesied evil day had in fact arrived, their behavior would become far more difficult to predict.\"\n\nWarning of the threat to American democracy posed by right-wing populist movements led by demagogues who mobilize support for mob rule or even a fascist revolution by exploiting the fear of conspiracies, Berlet writes that Right-wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia, authoritarianism, scapegoating, and conspiracism. This can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters, legitimize acts of discrimination (or even violence), and open the door for revolutionary right-wing populist movements, such as fascism, to recruit from the reformist populist movements.\nCriticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community. Despite believing themselves to be \"freedom fighters\", many right-wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed libertarianism, such as Christian dominionism, authoritarian ultranationalism, white supremacy and eliminationism.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnti-globalization movement\nBrainwashing\nClimate change denial\nCriticisms of globalization\nZionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe following is a list of non-self-published non-fiction books that discuss New World Order conspiracy theories.\n\nCarr, William Guy (1954).

        "title": "Eye of Providence",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Eye of Providence or All-Seeing Eye is a symbol depicting an eye, often enclosed in a triangle and surrounded by rays of light or a halo, intended to represent Providence, as the eye watches over the workers of mankind. A well-known example of the Eye of Providence appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, which is depicted on the United States one-dollar bill.\n\n\n== Use by governments and confederations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn 1782, the Eye of Providence was adopted as part of the symbolism featured on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States. It was first proposed as an element of the Great Seal by the first of three design committees in 1776, and it is thought to be the suggestion of the artistic consultant Pierre Eugene du Simitiere. At the time, it was a conventional symbol for God’s benevolent oversight.\nIn his original proposal to the committee, du Simitiere placed the Eye over shields so as to symbolize each of the original thirteen states of the Union. On the version of the seal that would eventually be approved, the Eye is positioned above an unfinished pyramid of thirteen steps (again symbolizing the original States, but also incorporating the nation's potential for future growth). Such symbolism is explained through the motto that appears above the Eye, annuit cœptis, meaning \"He approves [our] undertakings\" (or \"has approved\").\nPerhaps due to its use in the design of the Great Seal, the Eye has made its way into other American seals and logos, such as, for example:\n\nThe Seal of Colorado\nThe city seal of Kenosha, Wisconsin\nDARPA's Information Awareness Office\n\n\n==== U.S. currency ====\nThe Eye of Providence has been used among various forms of currency throughout U.S. history, including:\n\nthe United States one-dollar bill, as part of the Great Seal\nthe Vermont Copper\nNova Constellatio patterns of 1783\nNova Constellatio coppers of 1783 and 1785\nsome Immune Columbia issues\n\n\n=== Lithuania ===\nThe Eye of Providence appears on several Lithuanian coats of arms, including those of:\n\nAlovė\nBaisogala\nKalvarija\nPlungė (and its flag)\nŠiauliai (and its flag)\n\n\n=== Other countries ===\n\nThe Eye of Providence appears on the coats of arms of Victoria, Canada; Brasłaŭ, Belarus; Neman, Russia; Radekhiv, Ukraine; and Radzymin and Wilamowice, Poland. The Eye was also part of the flag and coat of arms adopted by the Confederation of the Equator, a short-lived 1824 secessionist revolt in the northeastern provinces of Brazil. In the United Kingdom, the symbol was part of the Guards Division insignia, created in 1915.\nIn Estonia, the 50 krooni note shows the Eye as part of a depiction of the pipe organ of the Käina church. Likewise, the (old) 500 Ukrainian hryvnia note also depicts the Eye.\nThe Eye was included in the original publication of France's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which also borrows iconography from the Ten Commandments. Similarly, the symbol is featured on the front page of the Constitution of Serbia from 1835.\nIn Nigeria, the eye symbol is part of the Nigeria Customs Service logo.\n\n\n== Freemasonry ==\n\nCommonly, the Eye of Providence is often associated with Freemasonry, first appearing as part of the standard Freemason iconography in 1797 with the publication of Thomas Smith Webb's The Freemason's Monitor. \nIn this use, the Eye, representing the all-seeing eye of God, serves as a reminder that humanity's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God—who is referred to in Masonry as the Great Architect of the Universe. Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a semicircular glory below it, and is sometimes enclosed by a triangle.\nPopular among conspiracy theorists is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, the only Mason among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal was Benjamin Franklin, whose ideas for the seal were not adopted. Likewise, various Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.\n\n\n== Use in religion ==\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\n\nThe association of an eye with the concept of Divine Providence is found in Christianity. In late Renaissance European iconography, the Eye, surrounded by a triangle, was an explicit symbol of the Christian Holy Trinity. The Eye of Providence was later painted above an image of three faces in Pontormo's 1525 Supper at Emmaus. Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or sunbursts. The Eye of God in a triangle is still used in church architecture and Christian art to symbolize the Trinity and God's omnipresence and divine providence. \nThe Eye of Providence is notably featured on the following buildings of the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:\n\nThe Mannheim Jesuit Church in Mannheim, Germany\nThe Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia\nThe Shio-Mgvime Monastery in Mtskheta, Georgia\nThe Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n\n=== University/college insignia and logos of organisations ===\nSeveral universities and college fraternities use the Eye of Providence in their coats of arms, seals, or badges, notably: \n\nDelta Tau Delta based in Fishers, Indiana\nPhi Kappa Psi based in Indianapolis, Indiana\nPhi Delta Theta based in Oxford, Ohio\nDelta Kappa Epsilon based in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nPrinceton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey\nThe University of Chile in Santiago, Chile\nThe University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaodaism § The Divine Eye\nEye of Horus\nEye of Ra\nPyramidion\nThird eye\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Eye of Providence at Wikimedia Commons",

        "title": "Conspiracy theory",
        "wikipedia_content": "A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that asserts the existence of a conspiracy (generally by powerful sinister groups, often political in motivation), when other explanations are more probable. The term generally has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal of a conspiracy theory is based in prejudice, emotional conviction, or insufficient evidence. A conspiracy theory is distinct from a conspiracy; it refers to a hypothesized conspiracy with specific characteristics, including but not limited to opposition to the mainstream consensus among those who are qualified to evaluate its accuracy, such as scientists or historians.\nConspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them. They are reinforced by circular reasoning: both evidence against the conspiracy and absence of evidence for it are misinterpreted as evidence of its truth. Stephan Lewandowsky observes \"This interpretation relies on the notion that, the stronger the evidence against a conspiracy, the more the conspirators must want people to believe their version of events.\" As a consequence, the conspiracy becomes a matter of faith rather than something that can be proven or disproven. Studies have linked belief in conspiracy theories to distrust of authority and political cynicism. Some researchers suggest that conspiracist ideation—belief in conspiracy theories—may be psychologically harmful or pathological. Such belief is correlated with psychological projection, paranoia, and Machiavellianism.\nPsychologists usually attribute belief in conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and insecure attachment, or to a form of cognitive bias called \"illusory pattern perception\". It has also been linked with the so-called Dark triad personality types, whose common feature is lack of empathy. However, a 2020 review article found that most cognitive scientists view conspiracy theorizing as typically nonpathological, given that unfounded belief in conspiracy is common across both historical and contemporary cultures, and may arise from innate human tendencies towards gossip, group cohesion, and religion. One historical review of conspiracy theories concluded that \"Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings that people experience when in crisis—fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control—stimulate a motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social situations.\"\nHistorically, conspiracy theories have been closely linked to prejudice, propaganda, witch hunts, wars, and genocides. They are often strongly believed by the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, and were used as justification by Timothy McVeigh and Anders Breivik, as well as by governments such as Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey. AIDS denialism by the government of South Africa, motivated by conspiracy theories, caused an estimated 330,000 deaths from AIDS. QAnon and denialism about the 2020 United States presidential election results led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and belief in conspiracy theories about genetically modified foods led the government of Zambia to reject food aid during a famine, at a time when three million people in the country were suffering from hunger. Conspiracy theories are a significant obstacle to improvements in public health, encouraging opposition to such public health measures as vaccination and water fluoridation. They have been linked to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Other effects of conspiracy theories include reduced trust in scientific evidence, radicalization and ideological reinforcement of extremist groups, and negative consequences for the economy.\nConspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media, the Internet, and social media, emerging as a cultural phenomenon of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. They are widespread around the world and are often commonly believed, some even held by the majority of the population. Interventions to reduce the occurrence of conspiracy beliefs include maintaining an open society, encouraging people to use analytical thinking, and reducing feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, or powerlessness.\n\n\n== Origin and usage ==\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines conspiracy theory as \"the theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; spec. a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event\". It cites a 1909 article in The American Historical Review as the earliest usage example, although it also appeared in print for several decades before.\nThe earliest known usage was by the American author Charles Astor Bristed, in a letter to the editor published in The New York Times on 11 January 1863. He used it to refer to claims that British aristocrats were intentionally weakening the United States during the American Civil War in order to advance their financial interests.\n\nEngland has had quite enough to do in Europe and Asia, without going out of her way to meddle with America. It was a physical and moral impossibility that she could be carrying on a gigantic conspiracy against us. But our masses, having only a rough general knowledge of foreign affairs, and not unnaturally somewhat exaggerating the space which we occupy in the world's eye, do not appreciate the complications which rendered such a conspiracy impossible. They only look at the sudden right-about-face movement of the English Press and public, which is most readily accounted for on the conspiracy theory.\nThe term is also used as a way to discredit dissenting analyses. Robert Blaskiewicz comments that examples of the term were used as early as the nineteenth century and states that its usage has always been derogatory. According to a study by Andrew McKenzie-McHarg, in contrast, in the nineteenth century the term conspiracy theory simply \"suggests a plausible postulate of a conspiracy\" and \"did not, at this stage, carry any connotations, either negative or positive\", though sometimes a postulate so-labeled was criticized. The author and activist George Monbiot argued that the terms \"conspiracy theory\" and \"conspiracy theorist\" are misleading, as conspiracies truly exist and theories are \"rational explanations subject to disproof\". Instead, he proposed the terms \"conspiracy fiction\" and \"conspiracy fantasist\".\n\n\n=== Alleged CIA origins ===\n\nThe term \"conspiracy theory\" is itself the subject of a conspiracy theory, which posits that the term was popularized by the CIA in order to discredit conspiratorial believers, particularly critics of the Warren Commission, by making them a target of ridicule. In his 2013 book Conspiracy Theory in America, the political scientist Lance deHaven-Smith wrote that the term entered everyday language in the United States after 1964, the year in which the Warren Commission published its findings on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, with The New York Times running five stories that year using the term.\nWhether the CIA was responsible for popularising the term \"conspiracy theory\" was analyzed by Michael Butter, a Professor of American Literary and Cultural History at the University of Tübingen. Butter wrote in 2020 that the CIA document Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report, which proponents of the theory use as evidence of CIA motive and intention, does not contain the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" in the singular, and only uses the term \"conspiracy theories\" once, in the sentence: \"Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organisation  [sic], for example, by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us.\"\n\n\n== Difference from conspiracy ==\nA conspiracy theory is not simply a conspiracy, which refers to any covert plan involving two or more people. In contrast, the term \"conspiracy theory\" refers to hypothesized conspiracies that have specific characteristics. For example, conspiracist beliefs invariably oppose the mainstream consensus among those people who are qualified to evaluate their accuracy, such as scientists or historians. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to socially persecuted knowledge or a stigmatized mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account. Michael Barkun describes a conspiracy theory as a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\".\nReal conspiracies, even very simple ones, are difficult to conceal and routinely experience unexpected problems. In contrast, conspiracy theories suggest that conspiracies are unrealistically successful and that groups of conspirators, such as bureaucracies, can act with near-perfect competence and secrecy. The causes of events or situations are simplified to exclude complex or interacting factors, as well as the role of chance and unintended consequences. Nearly all observations are explained as having been deliberately planned by the alleged conspirators.\nIn conspiracy theories, the conspirators are usually claimed to be acting with extreme malice. As described by Robert Brotherton:\n\nThe malevolent intent assumed by most conspiracy theories goes far beyond everyday plots borne out of self-interest, corruption, cruelty, and criminality. The postulated conspirators are not merely people with selfish agendas or differing values. Rather, conspiracy theories postulate a black-and-white world in which good is struggling against evil. The general public is cast as the victim of organised persecution, and the motives of the alleged conspirators often verge on pure maniacal evil. At the very least, the conspirators are said to have an almost inhuman disregard for the basic liberty and well-being of the general population. More grandiose conspiracy theories portray the conspirators as being Evil Incarnate: of having caused all the ills from which we suffer, committing abominable acts of unthinkable cruelty on a routine basis, and striving ultimately to subvert or destroy everything we hold dear.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others. Favored subjects include famous deaths and assassinations, morally dubious government activities, suppressed technologies, and \"false flag\" terrorism. Among the longest-standing and most widely recognized conspiracy theories are notions concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 1969 Apollo Moon landings, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as numerous theories pertaining to alleged plots for world domination by various groups, both real and imaginary.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nConspiracy beliefs are widespread around the world. In rural Africa, common targets of conspiracy theorizing include societal elites, enemy tribes, and the Western world, with conspirators often alleged to enact their plans via sorcery or witchcraft; one common belief identifies modern technology as itself being a form of sorcery, created with the goal of harming or controlling the people. In China, one widely published conspiracy theory claims that a number of events including the rise of Hitler, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and climate change were planned by the Rothschild family, which may have led to effects on discussions about China's currency policy.\nConspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media, contributing to conspiracism emerging as a cultural phenomenon in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The general predisposition to believe conspiracy theories cuts across partisan and ideological lines. Conspiratorial thinking is correlated with antigovernmental orientations and a low sense of political efficacy, with conspiracy believers perceiving a governmental threat to individual rights and displaying a deep skepticism that who one votes for really matters.\nConspiracy theories are often commonly believed, some even being held by the majority of the population. A broad cross-section of Americans today gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories. For instance, a study conducted in 2016 found that 10% of Americans think the chemtrail conspiracy theory is \"completely true\" and 20–30% think it is \"somewhat true\". This puts \"the equivalent of 120 million Americans in the 'chemtrails are real' camp\". Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in folklore.\nConspiracy theories are widely present on the Web in the form of blogs and YouTube videos, as well as on social media. Whether the Web has increased the prevalence of conspiracy theories or not is an open research question. The presence and representation of conspiracy theories in search engine results has been monitored and studied, showing significant variation across different topics, and a general absence of reputable, high-quality links in the results.\nOne conspiracy theory that propagated through former US President Barack Obama's time in office claimed that he was born in Kenya, instead of Hawaii where he was actually born. Former governor of Arkansas and political opponent of Obama Mike Huckabee made headlines in 2011 when he, among other members of Republican leadership, continued to question Obama's citizenship status.\n\n\n== Types ==\nA conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. According to Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum, historically, traditional conspiracism has entailed a \"theory\", but over time, \"conspiracy\" and \"theory\" have become decoupled, as modern conspiracism is often without any kind of theory behind it.\n\n\n=== Walker's five kinds ===\nJesse Walker (2013) has identified five kinds of conspiracy theories:\n\nThe \"Enemy Outside\" refers to theories based on figures alleged to be scheming against a community from without.\nThe \"Enemy Within\" finds the conspirators lurking inside the nation, indistinguishable from ordinary citizens.\nThe \"Enemy Above\" involves powerful people manipulating events for their own gain.\nThe \"Enemy Below\" features the lower classes working to overturn the social order.\nThe \"Benevolent Conspiracies\" are angelic forces that work behind the scenes to improve the world and help people.\n\n\n=== Barkun's three types ===\nMichael Barkun has identified three classifications of conspiracy theory:\n\nEvent conspiracy theories. This refers to limited and well-defined events. Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the Kennedy assassination, 9/11, and the spread of AIDS.\nSystemic conspiracy theories. The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of Jews, Freemasons, Communism, or the Catholic Church.\nSuperconspiracy theories. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically. At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force. His cited examples are the ideas of David Icke and Milton William Cooper.\n\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\nMurray Rothbard argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks Cui bono? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events. On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.\n\n\n== Lack of evidence ==\nBelief in conspiracy theories is generally based not on evidence, but in the faith of the believer. Noam Chomsky contrasts conspiracy theory to institutional analysis which focuses mostly on the public, long-term behavior of publicly known institutions, as recorded in, for example, scholarly documents or mainstream media reports. Conspiracy theory conversely posits the existence of secretive coalitions of individuals and speculates on their alleged activities. Belief in conspiracy theories is associated with biases in reasoning, such as the conjunction fallacy.\nClare Birchall at King's College London describes conspiracy theory as a \"form of popular knowledge or interpretation\". The use of the word 'knowledge' here suggests ways in which conspiracy theory may be considered in relation to legitimate modes of knowing. The relationship between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge, Birchall claims, is closer than common dismissals of conspiracy theory contend.\nTheories involving multiple conspirators that are proven to be correct, such as the Watergate scandal, are usually referred to as investigative journalism or historical analysis rather than conspiracy theory. Bjerg (2016) writes: \"the way we normally use\nthe term conspiracy theory excludes instances where the theory has been\ngenerally accepted as true. The Watergate scandal serves as the standard\nreference.\" By contrast, the term \"Watergate conspiracy theory\" is used to refer to a variety of hypotheses in which those convicted in the conspiracy were in fact the victims of a deeper conspiracy. There are also attempts to analyze the theory of conspiracy theories (conspiracy theory theory) to ensure that the term \"conspiracy theory\" is used to refer to narratives that have been debunked by experts, rather than as a generalized dismissal.\n\n\n== Rhetoric ==\nConspiracy theory rhetoric exploits several important cognitive biases, including proportionality bias, attribution bias, and confirmation bias. Their arguments often take the form of asking reasonable questions, but without providing an answer based on strong evidence. Conspiracy theories are most successful when proponents can gather followers from the general public, such as in politics, religion and journalism. These proponents may not necessarily believe the conspiracy theory; instead, they may just use it in an attempt to gain public approval. Conspiratorial claims can act as a successful rhetorical strategy to convince a portion of the public via appeal to emotion.\nConspiracy theories typically justify themselves by focusing on gaps or ambiguities in knowledge, and then arguing that the true explanation for this must be a conspiracy. In contrast, any evidence that directly supports their claims is generally of low quality. For example, conspiracy theories are often dependent on eyewitness testimony, despite its unreliability, while disregarding objective analyses of the evidence.\nConspiracy theories are not able to be falsified and are reinforced by fallacious arguments. In particular, the logical fallacy circular reasoning is used by conspiracy theorists: both evidence against the conspiracy and an absence of evidence for it are re-interpreted as evidence of its truth, whereby the conspiracy becomes a matter of faith rather than something that can be proved or disproved. The epistemic strategy of conspiracy theories has been called \"cascade logic\": each time new evidence becomes available, a conspiracy theory is able to dismiss it by claiming that even more people must be part of the cover-up. Any information that contradicts the conspiracy theory is suggested to be disinformation by the alleged conspiracy. Similarly, the continued lack of evidence directly supporting conspiracist claims is portrayed as confirming the existence of a conspiracy of silence; the fact that other people have not found or exposed any conspiracy is taken as evidence that those people are part of the plot, rather than considering that it may be because no conspiracy exists. This strategy lets conspiracy theories insulate themselves from neutral analyses of the evidence, and makes them resistant to questioning or correction, which is called \"epistemic self-insulation\".\n\nConspiracy theorists often take advantage of false balance in the media. They may claim to be presenting a legitimate alternative viewpoint that deserves equal time to argue its case; for example, this strategy has been used by the Teach the Controversy campaign to promote intelligent design, which often claims that there is a conspiracy of scientists suppressing their views. If they successfully find a platform to present their views in a debate format, they focus on using rhetorical ad hominems and attacking perceived flaws in the mainstream account, while avoiding any discussion of the shortcomings in their own position.\nThe typical approach of conspiracy theories is to challenge any action or statement from authorities, using even the most tenuous justifications. Responses are then assessed using a double standard, where failing to provide an immediate response to the satisfaction of the conspiracy theorist will be claimed to prove a conspiracy. Any minor errors in the response are heavily emphasized, while deficiencies in the arguments of other proponents are generally excused.\nIn science, conspiracists may suggest that a scientific theory can be disproven by a single perceived deficiency, even though such events are extremely rare. In addition, both disregarding the claims and attempting to address them will be interpreted as proof of a conspiracy. Other conspiracist arguments may not be scientific; for example, in response to the IPCC Second Assessment Report in 1996, much of the opposition centered on promoting a procedural objection to the report's creation. Specifically, it was claimed that part of the procedure reflected a conspiracy to silence dissenters, which served as motivation for opponents of the report and successfully redirected a significant amount of the public discussion away from the science.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\n\nHistorically, conspiracy theories have been closely linked to prejudice, witch hunts, wars, and genocides. They are often strongly believed by the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, and were used as justification by Timothy McVeigh, Anders Breivik and Brenton Tarrant, as well as by governments such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. AIDS denialism by the government of South Africa, motivated by conspiracy theories, caused an estimated 330,000 deaths from AIDS, while belief in conspiracy theories about genetically modified foods led the government of Zambia to reject food aid during a famine, at a time when 3 million people in the country were suffering from hunger.\nConspiracy theories are a significant obstacle to improvements in public health. People who believe in health-related conspiracy theories are less likely to follow medical advice, and more likely to use alternative medicine instead. Conspiratorial anti-vaccination beliefs, such as conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical companies, can result in reduced vaccination rates and have been linked to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Health-related conspiracy theories often inspire resistance to water fluoridation, and contributed to the impact of the Lancet MMR autism fraud.\nConspiracy theories are a fundamental component of a wide range of radicalized and extremist groups, where they may play an important role in reinforcing the ideology and psychology of their members as well as further radicalizing their beliefs. These conspiracy theories often share common themes, even among groups that would otherwise be fundamentally opposed, such as the antisemitic conspiracy theories found among political extremists on both the far right and far left. More generally, belief in conspiracy theories is associated with holding extreme and uncompromising viewpoints, and may help people in maintaining those viewpoints. While conspiracy theories are not always present in extremist groups, and do not always lead to violence when they are, they can make the group more extreme, provide an enemy to direct hatred towards, and isolate members from the rest of society. Conspiracy theories are most likely to inspire violence when they call for urgent action, appeal to prejudices, or demonize and scapegoat enemies.\nConspiracy theorizing in the workplace can also have economic consequences. For example, it leads to lower job satisfaction and lower commitment, resulting in workers being more likely to leave their jobs. Comparisons have also been made with the effects of workplace rumors, which share some characteristics with conspiracy theories and result in both decreased productivity and increased stress. Subsequent effects on managers include reduced profits, reduced trust from employees, and damage to the company's image.\nConspiracy theories can divert attention from important social, political, and scientific issues. In addition, they have been used to discredit scientific evidence to the general public or in a legal context. Conspiratorial strategies also share characteristics with those used by lawyers who are attempting to discredit expert testimony, such as claiming that the experts have ulterior motives in testifying, or attempting to find someone who will provide statements to imply that expert opinion is more divided than it actually is.\nIt is possible that conspiracy theories may also produce some compensatory benefits to society in certain situations. For example, they may help people identify governmental deceptions, particularly in repressive societies, and encourage government transparency. However, real conspiracies are normally revealed by people working within the system, such as whistleblowers and journalists, and most of the effort spent by conspiracy theorists is inherently misdirected. The most dangerous conspiracy theories are likely to be those that incite violence, scapegoat disadvantaged groups, or spread misinformation about important societal issues.\n\n\n== Interventions ==\n\n\n=== Target audience ===\nStrategies to address conspiracy theories have been divided into two categories based on whether the target audience is the conspiracy theorists or the general public. These strategies have been described as reducing either the supply or the demand for conspiracy theories. Both approaches can be used at the same time, although there may be issues of limited resources, or if arguments are used which may appeal to one audience at the expense of the other.\nBrief scientific literacy interventions, particularly those focusing on critical thinking skills, can effectively undermine conspiracy beliefs and related behaviors. Research led by Penn State scholars, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that enhancing scientific knowledge and reasoning through short interventions, such as videos explaining concepts like correlation and causation, reduces the endorsement of conspiracy theories. These interventions were most effective against conspiracy theories based on faulty reasoning and were successful even among groups prone to conspiracy beliefs. The studies, involving over 2,700 participants, highlight the importance of educational interventions in mitigating conspiracy beliefs, especially when timed to influence critical decision-making.\n\n\n==== General public ====\nPeople who feel empowered are more resistant to conspiracy theories. Methods to promote empowerment include encouraging people to use analytical thinking, priming people to think of situations where they are in control, and ensuring that decisions by society and government are seen to follow procedural fairness (the use of fair decision-making procedures).\nMethods of refutation which have shown effectiveness in various circumstances include: providing facts that demonstrate the conspiracy theory is false, attempting to discredit the source, explaining how the logic is invalid or misleading, and providing links to fact-checking websites. It can also be effective to use these strategies in advance, informing people that they could encounter misleading information in the future, and why the information should be rejected (also called inoculation or prebunking). While it has been suggested that discussing conspiracy theories can raise their profile and make them seem more legitimate to the public, the discussion can put people on guard instead as long as it is sufficiently persuasive.\nOther approaches to reduce the appeal of conspiracy theories in general among the public may be based in the emotional and social nature of conspiratorial beliefs. For example, interventions that promote analytical thinking in the general public are likely to be effective. Another approach is to intervene in ways that decrease negative emotions, and specifically to improve feelings of personal hope and empowerment.\n\n\n==== Conspiracy theorists ====\nIt is much more difficult to convince people who already believe in conspiracy theories. Conspiracist belief systems are not based on external evidence, but instead use circular logic where every belief is supported by other conspiracist beliefs. In addition, conspiracy theories have a \"self-sealing\" nature, in which the types of arguments used to support them make them resistant to questioning from others.\nCharacteristics of successful strategies for reaching conspiracy theorists have been divided into several broad categories: 1) Arguments can be presented by \"trusted messengers\", such as people who were formerly members of an extremist group. 2) Since conspiracy theorists think of themselves as people who value critical thinking, this can be affirmed and then redirected to encourage being more critical when analyzing the conspiracy theory. 3) Approaches demonstrate empathy, and are based on building understanding together, which is supported by modeling open-mindedness in order to encourage the conspiracy theorists to do likewise. 4) The conspiracy theories are not attacked with ridicule or aggressive deconstruction, and interactions are not treated like an argument to be won; this approach can work with the general public, but among conspiracy theorists it may simply be rejected.\nInterventions that reduce feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, or powerlessness result in a reduction in conspiracy beliefs. Other possible strategies to mitigate the effect of conspiracy theories include education, media literacy, and increasing governmental openness and transparency. Due to the relationship between conspiracy theories and political extremism, the academic literature on deradicalization is also important.\nOne approach describes conspiracy theories as resulting from a \"crippled epistemology\", in which a person encounters or accepts very few relevant sources of information. A conspiracy theory is more likely to appear justified to people with a limited \"informational environment\" who only encounter misleading information. These people may be \"epistemologically isolated\" in self-enclosed networks. From the perspective of people within these networks, disconnected from the information available to the rest of society, believing in conspiracy theories may appear to be justified. In these cases, the solution would be to break the group's informational isolation.\n\n\n=== Reducing transmission ===\nPublic exposure to conspiracy theories can be reduced by interventions that reduce their ability to spread, such as by encouraging people to reflect before sharing a news story. Researchers Carlos Diaz Ruiz and Tomas Nilsson have proposed technical and rhetorical interventions to counter the spread of conspiracy theories on social media.\n\n\n=== Government policies ===\nThe primary defense against conspiracy theories is to maintain an open society, in which many sources of reliable information are available, and government sources are known to be credible rather than propaganda. Additionally, independent nongovernmental organizations are able to correct misinformation without requiring people to trust the government. The absence of civil rights and civil liberties reduces the number of information sources available to the population, which may lead people to support conspiracy theories. Since the credibility of conspiracy theories can be increased if governments act dishonestly or otherwise engage in objectionable actions, avoiding such actions is also a relevant strategy.\nJoseph Pierre has said that mistrust in authoritative institutions is the core component underlying many conspiracy theories and that this mistrust creates an epistemic vacuum and makes individuals searching for answers vulnerable to misinformation. Therefore, one possible solution is offering consumers a seat at the table to mend their mistrust in institutions. Regarding the challenges of this approach, Pierre has said, \"The challenge with acknowledging areas of uncertainty within a public sphere is that doing so can be weaponized to reinforce a post-truth view of the world in which everything is debatable, and any counter-position is just as valid. Although I like to think of myself as a middle of the road kind of individual, it is important to keep in mind that the truth does not always lie in the middle of a debate, whether we are talking about climate change, vaccines, or antipsychotic medications.\"\nResearchers have recommended that public policies should take into account the possibility of conspiracy theories relating to any policy or policy area, and prepare to combat them in advance. Conspiracy theories have suddenly arisen in the context of policy issues as disparate as land-use laws and bicycle-sharing programs. In the case of public communications by government officials, factors that improve the effectiveness of communication include using clear and simple messages, and using messengers which are trusted by the target population. Government information about conspiracy theories is more likely to be believed if the messenger is perceived as being part of someone's in-group. Official representatives may be more effective if they share characteristics with the target groups, such as ethnicity.\nIn addition, when the government communicates with citizens to combat conspiracy theories, online methods are more efficient compared to other methods such as print publications. This also promotes transparency, can improve a message's perceived trustworthiness, and is more effective at reaching underrepresented demographics. However, as of 2019, many governmental websites do not take full advantage of the available information-sharing opportunities. Similarly, social media accounts need to be used effectively in order to achieve meaningful communication with the public, such as by responding to requests that citizens send to those accounts. Other steps include adapting messages to the communication styles used on the social media platform in question, and promoting a culture of openness. Since mixed messaging can support conspiracy theories, it is also important to avoid conflicting accounts, such as by ensuring the accuracy of messages on the social media accounts of individual members of the organization.\n\n\n=== Public health campaigns ===\nSuccessful methods for dispelling conspiracy theories have been studied in the context of public health campaigns. A key characteristic of communication strategies to address medical conspiracy theories is the use of techniques that rely less on emotional appeals. It is more effective to use methods that encourage people to process information rationally. The use of visual aids is also an essential part of these strategies. Since conspiracy theories are based on intuitive thinking, and visual information processing relies on intuition, visual aids are able to compete directly for the public's attention.\nIn public health campaigns, information retention by the public is highest for loss-framed messages that include more extreme outcomes. However, excessively appealing to catastrophic scenarios (e.g. low vaccination rates causing an epidemic) may provoke anxiety, which is associated with conspiracism and could increase belief in conspiracy theories instead. Scare tactics have sometimes had mixed results, but are generally considered ineffective. An example of this is the use of images that showcase disturbing health outcomes, such as the impact of smoking on dental health. One possible explanation is that information processed via the fear response is typically not evaluated rationally, which may prevent the message from being linked to the desired behaviors.\nA particularly important technique is the use of focus groups to understand exactly what people believe, and the reasons they give for those beliefs. This allows messaging to focus on the specific concerns that people identify, and on topics that are easily misinterpreted by the public, since these are factors which conspiracy theories can take advantage of. In addition, discussions with focus groups and observations of the group dynamics can indicate which anti-conspiracist ideas are most likely to spread.\nInterventions that address medical conspiracy theories by reducing powerlessness include emphasizing the principle of informed consent, giving patients all the relevant information without imposing decisions on them, to ensure that they have a sense of control. Improving access to healthcare also reduces medical conspiracism. However, doing so by political efforts can also fuel additional conspiracy theories, which occurred with the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in the United States. Another successful strategy is to require people to watch a short video when they fulfil requirements such as registration for school or a drivers' license, which has been demonstrated to improve vaccination rates and signups for organ donation.\nAnother approach is based on viewing conspiracy theories as narratives which express personal and cultural values, making them less susceptible to straightforward factual corrections, and more effectively addressed by counter-narratives. Counter-narratives can be more engaging and memorable than simple corrections, and can be adapted to the specific values held by individuals and cultures. These narratives may depict personal experiences, or alternatively they can be cultural narratives. In the context of vaccination, examples of cultural narratives include stories about scientific breakthroughs, about the world before vaccinations, or about heroic and altruistic researchers. The themes to be addressed would be those that could be exploited by conspiracy theories to increase vaccine hesitancy, such as perceptions of vaccine risk, lack of patient empowerment, and lack of trust in medical authorities.\n\n\n=== Backfire effects ===\nIt has been suggested that directly countering misinformation can be counterproductive. For example, since conspiracy theories can reinterpret disconfirming information as part of their narrative, refuting a claim can result in accidentally reinforcing it, which is referred to as a \"backfire effect\". In addition, publishing criticism of conspiracy theories can result in legitimizing them. In this context, possible interventions include carefully selecting which conspiracy theories to refute, requesting additional analyses from independent observers, and introducing cognitive diversity into conspiratorial communities by undermining their poor epistemology. Any legitimization effect might also be reduced by responding to more conspiracy theories rather than fewer.\nThere are psychological mechanisms by which backfire effects could potentially occur, but the evidence on this topic is mixed, and backfire effects are very rare in practice. A 2020 review of the scientific literature on backfire effects found that there have been widespread failures to replicate their existence, even under conditions that would be theoretically favorable to observing them. Due to the lack of reproducibility, as of 2020 most researchers believe that backfire effects are either unlikely to occur on the broader population level, or they only occur in very specific circumstances, or they do not exist. Brendan Nyhan, one of the researchers who initially proposed the occurrence of backfire effects, wrote in 2021 that the persistence of misinformation is most likely due to other factors.\nIn general, people do reject conspiracy theories when they learn about their contradictions and lack of evidence. For most people, corrections and fact-checking are very unlikely to have a negative impact, and there is no specific group of people in which backfire effects have been consistently observed. Presenting people with factual corrections, or highlighting the logical contradictions in conspiracy theories, has been demonstrated to have a positive effect in many circumstances. For example, this has been studied in the case of informing believers in 9/11 conspiracy theories about statements by actual experts and witnesses. One possibility is that criticism is most likely to backfire if it challenges someone's worldview or identity. This suggests that an effective approach may be to provide criticism while avoiding such challenges.\n\n\n== Psychology ==\nThe widespread belief in conspiracy theories has become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists, and experts in folklore since at least the 1960s, when a number of conspiracy theories arose regarding the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Sociologist Türkay Salim Nefes underlines the political nature of conspiracy theories. He suggests that one of the most important characteristics of these accounts is their attempt to unveil the \"real but hidden\" power relations in social groups. The term \"conspiracism\" was popularized by academic Frank P. Mintz in the 1980s. According to Mintz, conspiracism denotes \"belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history\":: 4 \n\nConspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere. It identifies elites, blames them for economic and social catastrophes, and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power. As such, conspiracy theories do not typify a particular epoch or ideology.: 199 \nResearch suggests, on a psychological level, conspiracist ideation—belief in conspiracy theories—can be harmful or pathological, and is highly correlated with psychological projection, as well as with paranoia, which is predicted by the degree of a person's Machiavellianism. The propensity to believe in conspiracy theories is strongly associated with the mental health disorder of schizotypy. Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media, emerging as a cultural phenomenon of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Exposure to conspiracy theories in news media and popular entertainment increases receptiveness to conspiratorial ideas, and has also increased the social acceptability of fringe beliefs.\nConspiracy theories often make use of complicated and detailed arguments, including ones which appear to be analytical or scientific. However, belief in conspiracy theories is primarily driven by emotion. One of the most widely confirmed facts about conspiracy theories is that belief in a single conspiracy theory tends be correlated with belief in other conspiracy theories. This even applies when the conspiracy theories directly contradict each other, e.g. believing that Osama bin Laden was already dead before his compound in Pakistan was attacked makes the same person more likely to believe that he is still alive. One conclusion from this finding is that the content of a conspiracist belief is less important than the idea of a coverup by the authorities. Analytical thinking aids in reducing belief in conspiracy theories, in part because it emphasizes rational and critical cognition.\nSome psychological scientists assert that explanations related to conspiracy theories can be, and often are \"internally consistent\" with strong beliefs that had previously been held prior to the event that sparked the conspiracy. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in other unsubstantiated claims – including pseudoscience and paranormal phenomena.\n\n\n=== Attractions ===\nPsychological motives for believing in conspiracy theories can be categorized as epistemic, existential, or social. These motives are particularly acute in vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. However, it does not appear that the beliefs help to address these motives; in fact, they may be self-defeating, acting to make the situation worse instead. For example, while conspiratorial beliefs can result from a perceived sense of powerlessness, exposure to conspiracy theories immediately suppresses personal feelings of autonomy and control. Furthermore, they also make people less likely to take actions that could improve their circumstances.\nThis is additionally supported by the fact that conspiracy theories have a number of disadvantageous attributes. For example, they promote a negative and distrustful view of other people and groups, who are allegedly acting based on antisocial and cynical motivations. This is expected to lead to increased alienation and anomie, and reduced social capital. Similarly, they depict the public as ignorant and powerless against the alleged conspirators, with important aspects of society determined by malevolent forces, a viewpoint which is likely to be disempowering.\nEach person may endorse conspiracy theories for one of many different reasons. The most consistently demonstrated characteristics of people who find conspiracy theories appealing are a feeling of alienation, unhappiness or dissatisfaction with their situation, an unconventional worldview, and a feeling of disempowerment. While various aspects of personality affect susceptibility to conspiracy theories, none of the Big Five personality traits are associated with conspiracy beliefs.\nThe political scientist Michael Barkun, discussing the usage of \"conspiracy theory\" in contemporary American culture, holds that this term is used for a belief that explains an event as the result of a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end. According to Barkun, the appeal of conspiracism is threefold:\n\nFirst, conspiracy theories claim to explain what institutional analysis cannot. They appear to make sense out of a world that is otherwise confusing.\nSecond, they do so in an appealingly simple way, by dividing the world sharply between the forces of light, and the forces of darkness. They trace all evil back to a single source, the conspirators and their agents.\nThird, conspiracy theories are often presented as special, secret knowledge unknown or unappreciated by others. For conspiracy theorists, the masses are a brainwashed herd, while the conspiracy theorists in the know can congratulate themselves on penetrating the plotters' deceptions.\nThis third point is supported by research of Roland Imhoff, professor of social psychology at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. The research suggests that the smaller the minority believing in a specific theory, the more attractive it is to conspiracy theorists. Humanistic psychologists argue that even if a posited cabal behind an alleged conspiracy is almost always perceived as hostile, there often remains an element of reassurance for theorists. This is because it is a consolation to imagine that difficulties in human affairs are created by humans, and remain within human control. If a cabal can be implicated, there may be a hope of breaking its power or of joining it. Belief in the power of a cabal is an implicit assertion of human dignity—an unconscious affirmation that man is responsible for his own destiny.\nPeople formulate conspiracy theories to explain, for example, power relations in social groups and the perceived existence of evil forces. Proposed psychological origins of conspiracy theorising include projection; the personal need to explain \"a significant event [with] a significant cause;\" and the product of various kinds and stages of thought disorder, such as paranoid disposition, ranging in severity to diagnosable mental illnesses. Some people prefer socio-political explanations over the insecurity of encountering random, unpredictable, or otherwise inexplicable events. According to Berlet and Lyons, \"Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm\".\n\n\n=== Causes ===\n\nSome psychologists believe that a search for meaning is common in conspiracism. Once cognized, confirmation bias and avoidance of cognitive dissonance may reinforce the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become embedded within a social group, communal reinforcement may also play a part.\nInquiry into possible motives behind the accepting of irrational conspiracy theories has linked these beliefs to distress resulting from an event that occurred, such as the events of 9/11. Additional research suggests that \"delusional ideation\" is the trait most likely to indicate a stronger belief in conspiracy theories. Research also shows an increased attachment to these irrational beliefs leads to a decreased desire for civic engagement. Belief in conspiracy theories is correlated with low intelligence, lower analytical thinking, anxiety disorders, paranoia, and authoritarian beliefs.\nProfessor Quassim Cassam argues that conspiracy theorists hold their beliefs due to flaws in their thinking and more precisely, their intellectual character. He cites philosopher Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski and her book Virtues of the Mind in outlining intellectual virtues (such as humility, caution and carefulness) and intellectual vices (such as gullibility, carelessness and closed-mindedness). Whereas intellectual virtues help in reaching sound examination, intellectual vices \"impede effective and responsible inquiry\", meaning that those who are prone to believing in conspiracy theories possess certain vices while lacking necessary virtues.\nSome researchers have suggested that conspiracy theories could be partially caused by psychological mechanisms the human brain possesses for detecting dangerous coalitions. Such a mechanism could have been useful in the small-scale environment humanity evolved in but are mismatched in a modern, complex society and thus \"misfire\", perceiving conspiracies where none exist.\n\n\n==== Projection ====\nSome historians have argued that psychological projection is prevalent amongst conspiracy theorists. This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:\n\nThis enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry. ... The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through \"front\" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments\".\n\n\n==== Physiology ====\nMarcel Danesi suggests that people who believe conspiracy theories have difficulty rethinking situations. Exposure to those theories has caused neural pathways which are more rigid and less subject to change. Initial susceptibility to believing the lies, dehumanizing language, and metaphors of these theories leads to the acceptance of larger and more extensive theories because the hardened neural pathways are already present. Repetition of the \"facts\" of conspiracy theories and their connected lies simply reinforces the rigidity of those pathways. Thus, conspiracy theories and dehumanizing lies are not mere hyperbole, they can actually change the way people think:\n\nUnfortunately, research into this brain wiring also shows that once people begin to believe lies, they are unlikely to change their minds even when confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. It is a form of brainwashing. Once the brain has carved out a well-worn path of believing deceit, it is even harder to step out of that path – which is how fanatics are born. Instead, these people will seek out information that confirms their beliefs, avoid anything that is in conflict with them, or even turn the contrasting information on its head, so as to make it fit their beliefs.People with strong convictions will have a hard time changing their minds, given how embedded a lie becomes in the mind. In fact, there are scientists and scholars still studying the best tools and tricks to combat lies with some combination of brain training and linguistic awareness.\n\n\n== Sociology ==\nIn addition to psychological factors such as conspiracist ideation, sociological factors also help account for who believes in which conspiracy theories. Such theories tend to get more traction among election losers in society, for example, and the emphasis of conspiracy theories by elites and leaders tends to increase belief among followers who have higher levels of conspiracy thinking. Christopher Hitchens described conspiracy theories as the \"exhaust fumes of democracy\": the unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large number of people.\nConspiracy theories may be emotionally satisfying, by assigning blame to a group to which the theorist does not belong and so absolving the theorist of moral or political responsibility in society. Likewise, Roger Cohen writing for The New York Times has said that, \"captive minds; ... resort to conspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of the powerless. If you cannot change your own life, it must be that some greater force controls the world.\"\nSociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for the origins of World War I, \"Those events that are most important are hardest to understand because they attract the greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans.\" Justin Fox of Time magazine argues that Wall Street traders are among the most conspiracy-minded group of people, and ascribes this to the reality of some financial market conspiracies, and to the ability of conspiracy theories to provide necessary orientation in the market's day-to-day movements.\n\n\n=== Influence of critical theory ===\nBruno Latour notes that the language and intellectual tactics of critical theory have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including climate-change denialists and the 9/11 Truth movement: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\"\n\n\n=== Fusion paranoia ===\nMichael Kelly, a Washington Post journalist and critic of anti-war movements on both the left and right, coined the term \"fusion paranoia\" to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and civil liberties, which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared anti-government views.\nBarkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in mass media, thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for apocalyptic or millenarian scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.\n\n\n== Viability ==\nAs evidence that undermines an alleged conspiracy grows, the number of alleged conspirators also grows in the minds of conspiracy theorists. This is because of an assumption that the alleged conspirators often have competing interests. For example, if Republican President George W. Bush is allegedly responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the Democratic party did not pursue exposing this alleged plot, that must mean that both the Democratic and Republican parties are conspirators in the alleged plot. It also assumes that the alleged conspirators are so competent that they can fool the entire world, but so incompetent that even the unskilled conspiracy theorists can find mistakes they make that prove the fraud. At some point, the number of alleged conspirators, combined with the contradictions within the alleged conspirators' interests and competence, becomes so great that maintaining the theory becomes an obvious exercise in absurdity.\nThe physicist David Robert Grimes estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved. His calculations used data from the PRISM surveillance program, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, and the FBI forensic scandal. Grimes estimated that:\n\nA Moon landing hoax would require the involvement of 411,000 people and would be exposed within 3.68 years;\nClimate-change fraud would require a minimum of 29,083 people (published climate scientists only) and would be exposed within 26.77 years, or up to 405,000 people, in which case it would be exposed within 3.70 years;\nA vaccination conspiracy would require a minimum of 22,000 people (without drug companies) and would be exposed within at least 3.15 years and at most 34.78 years depending on the number involved;\nA conspiracy to suppress a cure for cancer would require 714,000 people and would be exposed within 3.17 years.\nGrimes's study did not consider exposure by sources outside of the alleged conspiracy. It only considered exposure from within the alleged conspiracy through whistleblowers or through incompetence. Subsequent comments on the PubPeer website point out that these calculations must exclude successful conspiracies since, by definition, we don't know about them, and are wrong by an order of magnitude about Bletchley Park, which remained a secret far longer than Grimes' calculations predicted.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term \"truth seeker\" is adopted by some conspiracy theorists when describing themselves on social media. Conspiracy theorists are often referred to derogatorily as \"cookers\" in Australia. The term \"cooker\" is also loosely associated with the far right.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe philosopher Karl Popper described the central problem of conspiracy theories as a form of fundamental attribution error, where every event is generally perceived as being intentional and planned, greatly underestimating the effects of randomness and unintended consequences. In his book The Open Society and Its Enemies, he used the term \"the conspiracy theory of society\" to denote the idea that social phenomena such as \"war, unemployment, poverty, shortages ... [are] the result of direct design by some powerful individuals and groups\". Popper argued that totalitarianism was founded on conspiracy theories which drew on imaginary plots which were driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism, chauvinism, or racism. He also noted that conspirators very rarely achieved their goal.\nHistorically, real conspiracies have usually had little effect on history and have had unforeseen consequences for the conspirators, in contrast to conspiracy theories which often posit grand, sinister organizations, or world-changing events, the evidence for which has been erased or obscured. As described by Bruce Cumings, history is instead \"moved by the broad forces and large structures of human collectivities\".\n\n\n=== Arab world ===\n\nConspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of Arab culture and politics. Variants include conspiracies involving colonialism, Zionism, superpowers, oil, and the war on terrorism, which is often referred to in Arab media as a \"war against Islam\". For example, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an infamous hoax document purporting to be a Jewish plan for world domination, is commonly read and promoted in the Muslim world. Roger Cohen has suggested that the popularity of conspiracy theories in the Arab world is \"the ultimate refuge of the powerless\". Al-Mumin Said has noted the danger of such theories, for they \"keep us not only from the truth but also from confronting our faults and problems\". Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri used conspiracy theories about the United States to gain support for al-Qaeda in the Arab world, and as rhetoric to distinguish themselves from similar groups, although they may not have believed the conspiratorial claims themselves.\n\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nConspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of culture and politics in Turkey. Conspiracism is an important phenomenon in understanding Turkish politics. This is explained by a desire to \"make up for our lost Ottoman grandeur\", the humiliation of perceiving Turkey as part of \"the malfunctioning half\" of the world, and a \"low level of media literacy among the Turkish population.\"\nThere are a wide variety of conspiracy theories including the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory, the international Jewish conspiracy theory, and the war against Islam conspiracy theory. For example, Islamists, dissatisfied with the modernist and secularist reforms that took place throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic, have put forward many conspiracy theories to defame the Treaty of Lausanne, an important peace treaty for the country, and the republic's founder Kemal Atatürk. Another example is the Sèvres syndrome, a reference to the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920, a popular belief in Turkey that dangerous internal and external enemies, especially the West, are \"conspiring to weaken and carve up the Turkish Republic\".\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThe historian Richard Hofstadter addressed the role of paranoia and conspiracism throughout U.S. history in his 1964 essay \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\". Bernard Bailyn's classic The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967) notes that a similar phenomenon could be found in North America during the time preceding the American Revolution. Conspiracism labels people's attitudes as well as the type of conspiracy theories that are more global and historical in proportion.\nHarry G. West and others have noted that while conspiracy theorists may often be dismissed as a fringe minority, certain evidence suggests that a wide range of the U.S. maintains a belief in conspiracy theories. West also compares those theories to hypernationalism and religious fundamentalism. Theologian Robert Jewett and philosopher John Shelton Lawrence attribute the enduring popularity of conspiracy theories in the U.S. to the Cold War, McCarthyism, and counterculture rejection of authority. They state that among both the left-wing and right-wing, there remains a willingness to use real events, such as Soviet plots, inconsistencies in the Warren Report, and the 9/11 attacks, to support the existence of unverified and ongoing large-scale conspiracies.\nIn his studies of \"American political demonology\", historian Michael Paul Rogin too analyzed this paranoid style of politics that has occurred throughout American history. Conspiracy theories frequently identify an imaginary subversive group that is supposedly attacking the nation and requires the government and allied forces to engage in harsh extra-legal repression of those threatening subversives. Rogin cites examples from the Red Scares of 1919, to McCarthy's anti-communist campaign in the 1950s and more recently fears of immigrant hordes invading the US. Unlike Hofstadter, Rogin saw these \"countersubversive\" fears as frequently coming from those in power and dominant groups, instead of from the dispossessed. Unlike Robert Jewett, Rogin blamed not the counterculture, but America's dominant culture of liberal individualism and the fears it stimulated to explain the periodic eruption of irrational conspiracy theories. The Watergate scandal has also been used to bestow legitimacy to other conspiracy theories, with Richard Nixon himself commenting that it served as a \"Rorschach ink blot\" which invited others to fill in the underlying pattern.\nHistorian Kathryn S. Olmsted cites three reasons why Americans are prone to believing in government conspiracies theories:\n\nGenuine government overreach and secrecy during the Cold War, such as Watergate, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, Project MKUltra, and the CIA's assassination attempts on Fidel Castro in collaboration with mobsters.\nPrecedent set by official government-sanctioned conspiracy theories for propaganda, such as claims of German infiltration of the U.S. during World War II or the debunked claim that Saddam Hussein played a role in the 9/11 attacks.\nDistrust fostered by the government's spying on and harassment of dissenters, such as the Sedition Act of 1918, COINTELPRO, and as part of various Red Scares.\nAlex Jones referenced numerous conspiracy theories for convincing his supporters to endorse Ron Paul over Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries and Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. Into the 2020s, the QAnon conspiracy theory alleges that Trump is fighting against a deep-state cabal of child sex-abusing and Satan-worshipping Democrats.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nConspiracy Theories, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy",

        "title": "Modern flat Earth beliefs",
        "wikipedia_content": "Pseudoscientific beliefs in a flat Earth are promoted by a number of organizations and individuals. The claims of modern flat Earth proponents are not based on scientific knowledge and are contrary to over two millennia of scientific consensus based on multiple confirming lines of evidence that Earth is roughly spherical. Flat Earth beliefs are classified by experts in philosophy and physics as a form of science denial.\nFlat Earth groups of the modern era date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by religion or conspiracy theories. Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused and promoted by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups. Many believers make use of social media to spread their views.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nContrary to the popular belief that the Earth was generally believed to be flat until a few hundred years ago, the spherical shape of the Earth (and other celestial bodies) has been widely accepted in the Western world (and universally by scholars) since at least the Hellenistic period (323 BCE–31 BCE), with the first known measurement of Earth's circumference conducted by Eratosthenes.\nIt is only comparatively recently that the Flat Earth concept has grown widespread support, due to Samuel Rowbotham in the 19th century. \nFlat Earth beliefs have had a notable recent resurgence since 2015, due to the internet.\n\n\n== 19th and early 20th centuries ==\n\nModern flat Earth belief originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham (1816–1884). Based on conclusions derived from his 1838 Bedford Level experiment, Rowbotham published the 1849 pamphlet titled Zetetic Astronomy, writing under the pseudonym \"Parallax\". He later expanded this into the book Earth Not a Globe, proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, Antarctica. Rowbotham further held that the Sun and Moon were 3,000 miles (4,800 km) above Earth and that the \"cosmos\" was 3,100 miles (5,000 km) above the Earth. He also published a leaflet titled The Inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures, which argued that the \"Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the Earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture\".\nRowbotham and followers like William Carpenter gained attention by successful use of pseudoscience in public debates with leading scientists such as Alfred Russel Wallace. Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York, shipping over a thousand copies of Zetetic Astronomy to the New York branch. Wallace repeated the Bedford Level experiment in 1870, correcting for atmospheric refraction and showing a spherical Earth.\nIn 1877, John Hampden produced a book A New Manual of Biblical Cosmography. Rowbotham also produced studies that purported to show that the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.\nAfter Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount established the Universal Zetetic Society in 1893, whose objective was \"the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation\". The society published a magazine, The Earth Not a Globe Review, which sold for twopence and remained active well into the early 20th century. A flat Earth journal, Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science, was published between 1901 and 1904, edited by Lady Blount. She held that the Bible was the unquestionable authority on the natural world and argued that one could not be a Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham's experiments, generating some counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The Universal Zetetic Society \"was revived under different names over the years—in 1956, 1972, and 2004\". The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary Earth, including Terra Firma by David Wardlaw Scott.\nOther notable flat Earthers from this time period include:\n\nWilliam Carpenter, a printer originally from Greenwich, was a supporter of Rowbotham. Carpenter published Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed – Proving the Earth not a Globe in eight parts from 1864 under the name Common Sense. He later emigrated to Baltimore, where he published One Hundred Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe in 1885. He wrote: \"There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet – notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe\", as well as: \"If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best – because the truest – thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty! This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\"\nJohn Jasper, an American slave turned prolific preacher, and friend of Carpenter's, echoed his friend's sentiments in his most famous sermon \"The Sun do move\", preached over 250 times, always by invitation. In a written account of his sermon, published in The Richmond Whig of March 19, 1878, Jasper says he would frequently cite the verse \"I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth\" and follow up by arguing: \"So we are living on a four-cornered earth; then, my friends, will you tell me how in the name of God can an earth with four corners be round!\" In the same article he argued: \"if the earth is like others say, who hold a different theory, peopled on the other side, those people would be obliged to walk on the ground with their feet upward like flies on the ceiling of a room\".\nIn Brockport, New York, in 1887, M. C. Flanders argued the case of a flat Earth for three nights against two scientific gentlemen defending sphericity. Five townsmen chosen as judges voted unanimously for a flat Earth at the end. The case was reported in the Brockport Democrat.\nJoseph W. Holden of Maine, a former justice of the peace, gave numerous lectures in New England and lectured on flat-Earth theory at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His fame stretched to North Carolina, where the Statesville Semi-weekly Landmark recorded at his death in 1900: \"We hold to the doctrine that the Earth is flat ourselves and we regret exceedingly to learn that one of our members is dead.\"\nIn 1898, during his solo circumnavigation of the world, Joshua Slocum encountered a group of flat-Earthers in Durban, South Africa. Three Boers, one of them a clergyman, presented Slocum with a pamphlet in which they set out to prove that the world was flat. Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Republic, advanced the same view: \"You don't mean round the world, it is impossible! You mean in the world. Impossible!\"\nFrom 1915 to 1942 Wilbur Glenn Voliva, who in 1906 took over the Christian Catholic Church, a Pentecostal sect that established a utopian community in Zion, Illinois, preached flat Earth doctrine. He used a photograph of a twelve-mile (19 km) stretch of the shoreline at Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, taken three feet (91 cm) above the waterline to prove his point. When the airship Italia disappeared on an expedition to the North Pole in 1928, he warned the world's press that it had sailed over the edge of the world. He offered a $5000 award ($98,590 in 2022 terms) for proving that the Earth is not flat, under his own conditions. Teaching a globular Earth was banned in the Zion schools, and the message was transmitted on his WCBD radio station.\nAlong with those who followed him, Frank Cherry (died 1963), the founder of the Black Hebrew Israelite religion, taught the existence of a flat Earth \"surrounded by three layers of heaven.\"\n\n\n== International Flat Earth Research Society ==\n\nIn 1956, Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society, better known as the \"Flat Earth Society\", as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society, running it as \"organising secretary\" from his home in Dover, England. Given Shenton's interest in alternative science and technology, the emphasis on religious arguments was less than in the predecessor society. This was just before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik; he responded: \"Would sailing round the Isle of Wight prove that it were spherical? It is just the same for those satellites.\"\nHis primary aim was to reach children before they were convinced about a spherical Earth. Despite plenty of publicity, the space race eroded Shenton's support in Britain until 1967, when he started to gain attention during the Apollo program. When satellite images showed Earth as a sphere, Shenton remarked: \"It's easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye\". Later asked about similar photographs taken by astronauts, he attributed curvature to the use of wide-angle lens, adding, \"It's a deception of the public and it isn't right\".\nIn 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a Polytechnic of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society after attempts to convince Eden Thomas, a former chairman, to take on the role; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.\n\nShenton died in 1971. Charles K. Johnson, a correspondent from California, inherited part of Shenton's library from Shenton's wife; he incorporated and became president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People's Church in California. Over the next three decades, under his leadership, the Flat Earth Society grew to a reported 3,500 members.\nJohnson spent years examining the studies of flat- and round-Earth theories and proposed evidence of a conspiracy against flat Earth: \"The idea of a spinning globe is only a conspiracy of error that Moses, Columbus, and FDR all fought...\" His article was published in the magazine Science Digest in 1980. It goes on to state: \"If it is a sphere, the surface of a large body of water must be curved. The Johnsons have checked the surfaces of Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea without detecting any curvature.\"\nJohnson issued many publications and handled all membership applications. The most famous publication was Flat Earth News, a quarterly, four-page tabloid. Johnson paid for these publications through annual member dues costing US$6 to US$10 over the course of his leadership. Johnson cited the Bible for his beliefs, and he saw scientists as pulling a hoax which would replace religion with science.\nThe Flat Earth Society's most recent planet model is that humanity lives on a disc, with the North Pole at its centre and a 150-foot-high (46 m) wall of ice, Antarctica, at the outer edge. The resulting map resembles the symbol of the United Nations, which Johnson used as evidence for his position. In this model, the Sun and Moon are each 32 miles (51 km) in diameter.\nThe Flat Earth Society recruited members by speaking against the US government and all its agencies, particularly NASA. Much of the society's literature in its early days focused on interpreting the Bible to mean that the Earth is flat, although they did try to offer scientific explanations and evidence.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nEugenie Scott called the group an example of \"extreme Biblical-literalist theology: The earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat, regardless of what science tells us\".\nAccording to some flat Earthers, the Flat Earth Society is a government-controlled organization whose true purpose is to make ridiculous claims about flat Earth and therefore discredit the flat Earth movement.\n\n\n=== Decline and relaunch ===\nAccording to Charles K. Johnson, the membership of the group rose to 3,500 under his leadership but began to decline after a fire at his house in 1997 which destroyed all of the records and contacts of the society's members. Johnson's wife, who helped manage the membership database, died shortly thereafter. Johnson himself died on 19 March 2001.\nIn 2004, Daniel Shenton (not related to Samuel) resurrected the Flat Earth Society, basing it around a web-based discussion forum. In the late 1990s, Thomas Dolby's 1984 album The Flat Earth inspired Shenton to look into the Flat Earth Society, and he came to believe in its ideas. He believes that no one has provided proof that the world is not flat. This eventually led to the official relaunch of the society in October 2009, and the creation of a new website, featuring a public collection of flat Earth literature and a wiki. Moreover, the society began accepting new members for the first time since 2001. Dolby accepted Shenton's offer of membership number 00001, although he does not believe the Earth is flat. As of July 2017, over 500 people had become members.\nIn 2013, part of this society broke away to form a new web-based group also featuring a forum and wiki.\n\n\n== By country ==\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nFlat Earth Society of Canada was established on 8 November 1970 by philosopher Leo Ferrari, writer Raymond Fraser and poet Alden Nowlan; and was active until 1984. Its archives are held at the University of New Brunswick.\nCalling themselves \"planoterrestrialists\", their aims were quite different from other flat Earth societies. They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories \"on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses.\" The parodic intention of the Society appeared in the writings of Ferrari, as he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the spherical Earth model. Ferrari also claimed to have nearly fallen off \"the Edge\" of the Earth at Brimstone Head on Fogo Island.\nFerrari was interviewed as an \"expert\" in the 1990 flat Earth mockumentary In Search of the Edge by Pancake Productions (a reference to the expression \"as flat as a pancake\"). In the accompanying study guide, Ferrari is outed as a \"globularist\", a nonce word for someone who believes the Earth is spherical. The real intent of the film, which was part-funded by the Ontario Arts Council and National Film Board of Canada, was to promote schoolchildren's critical thinking and media literacy by \"[attempting] to prove in convincing fashion, something everyone knew to be false.\"\n\n\n==== Relaunch ====\nMulti-media artist Kay Burns re-created the Flat Earth Society of Canada as an art project with her alter ego Iris Taylor as its president. Burns created an installation entitled the Museum of the Flat Earth, which included some artefacts from the 1970 group. It was exhibited in 2016 at the Flat Earth Outpost Café in Shoal Bay, Newfoundland.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy, there are no centralised societies on flat Earth. However, since the 2010s, small groups of conspiracy theorists, who carry out meetings, started to emerge and to spread flat Earth theories. Among these are Calogero Greco, Albino Galuppini and Agostino Favari, who in 2018–2019 organised several meetings in Palermo, Sicily, with an entry price of €20.\nAmong their claims, some include:\n\nNASA is similar to Disneyland and that astronauts are actors.\nThe April 2019 photo of the supermassive black hole at the core of the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 is fake.\nThe proof Earth is flat can be demonstrated with a filled bottle where, if placed horizontally, water never curves.\nIn addition to these, it is their common belief that the United States has a plan to create in Europe a new America open to everyone, where the only value is consumerism and that George Soros commands a satanic globalist conspiracy. They reject the past existence of dinosaurs, the Darwinian theory of evolution, and the authority of the scientific community, claiming scientists are Freemasons.\nFormer leader of the Five Star Movement political party Beppe Grillo showed interest in the group, admitting to admiring their free speech spirit and to wanting to participate at the May 2019 conference. However, Grillo did not appear.\n\n\n== Internet-era resurgence ==\nIn November 2017 \"more than five hundred people ... paid as much as $249 each to attend \"the first-ever Flat Earth Conference\", in a suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.  According to a 2018 YouGov opinion poll, \"just 66% of millennials firmly believe\" that the earth is round, with celebrities (rapper B.o.B., basketball players Kyrie Irving, Wilson Chandler, Draymond Green) advocating for flatness.\n\n\n=== Sociological explanations for counterfactual beliefs ===\n\nIn the Information Age, the availability of communications technology and social media such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous or not, to spread disinformation and attract others to erroneous ideas. One of the topics that has flourished in this environment is that of the flat Earth.\nThese sites have made it easier for like-minded theorists to connect with one another and mutually reinforce their beliefs. Social media has had a \"levelling effect\", in that experts have less sway in the public mind than they used to.\nYouTube has faced criticism for allowing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories through its platform, specifically, flat Earth. In 2019, YouTube stated that it was making changes in its software to reduce the distribution of videos based on conspiracy theories including flat Earth. Professor Asheley Landrum \"called on scientists themselves to fight back by using YouTube as a platform to communicate their own work. \"We don't want YouTube to be full of videos saying here are all these reasons the Earth is flat,\" she said. \"We need other videos saying here's why those reasons aren't real and here's a bunch of ways you can research it for yourself.\"\"\nIn the documentary Behind the Curve (2018) (which follows prominent modern flat-Earthers including Mark Sargent and Patricia Steere, as well as astrophysicists and psychologists who attempt to explain the growing fad), professor of psychiatry Joe Pierre offers as explanations: the  Dunning-Kruger effect (the phenomenon whereby ignorance in a given field makes people unable to recognize their own ignorance or lack of ability in that field); misunderstandings of simple observation; pseudoscientific practices which fail to separate reliable from unreliable conclusions; and a progressive divergence from reality that starts with a belief that conventional information sources and the government cannot be trusted.\nOut of the necessity to explain photographs of the earth in space, the observations of astronauts, why all major institutions such as governments, media outlets, schools, scientists, and airlines assert that the world is a sphere, etc., modern flat-Earthers very commonly embrace some form of conspiracy theory.  As Darryle Marble, a speaker at the Flat Earth Conference, told his audience, after watching hours of YouTube conspiracy videos on Sandy Hook, 9/11, false flags, the Bilderbergers, Rothschilds, Illuminati – \"Each thing started to make that much more sense.  I was already primed to receive the whole flat-Earth idea, because we had already come to the conclusion that we were being deceived about so many other things. So of course they would lie to us about this.\"\nConspiracy belief is often intertwined with conservative Christian belief. According to internet influencer Rob Skiba, \"the ultimate motivation\" of the (alleged) conspiracy of a round earth in space, \"many of us have come to believe, is hiding God.\" Reading the Bible, \"when you break down the text of what it represents, there's no way you can get a spinning heliocentric globe out of anything in the Bible.\" (According to author Alan Burdick, \"in style and substance, the flat-Earth movement is a close cousin of creationism.\")\nThey tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves, and often distrust or disagree with each other. Patricia Steere admitted in Behind the Curve that she wouldn't believe an event like the Boston Marathon bombing was real unless she had gotten her own leg blown off. Flat Earth believers in the documentary also professed belief in conspiracy theories about vaccines, genetically modified organisms, chemtrails, 9/11, and transgender people; some said dinosaurs and evolution were also fake, and that heliocentrism is a form of Sun worship.\nThe scientific experts in Behind the Curve pointed to confirmation bias as a way to maintain a counterfactual belief, by cherry-picking only supporting evidence, and dismissing any disconfirming evidence as part of the purported global conspiracy.\nSome flat Earth believers, such as authors Zen Garcia and Edward Hendrie, cite the Christian Bible as evidence. Some critics of the flat Earth idea, such as astronomer Danny R. Faulkner, are young Earth creationists and attempt to explain away the Bible's supposed flat Earth language.\nOn 3 May 2018, Steven Novella analysed the modern belief in a flat Earth, and concluded that, despite what most people think about the subject, the believers are being sincere in their belief that the Earth is flat, and are not \"just saying that to wind us up\". He stated that:\n\nIn the end that is the core malfunction of the flat-earthers, and the modern populist rejection of expertise in general. It is a horrifically simplistic view of the world that ignores (partly out of ignorance, and partly out of motivated reasoning) to [sic] real complexities of our civilisation. It is ultimately lazy, childish, and self-indulgent, resulting in a profound level of ignorance drowning in motivated reasoning.\nThe British sceptical activist Michael Marshall attended the annual Flat Earth UK Convention on 27–29 April 2018 and noted disagreement on several views among believers in a flat Earth. To Marshall, one of the most telling moments at the convention was the \"Flat Earth Addiction\" test that was based on a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a cult, without the convention attendees realising the possibility of themselves being in a cult.\n\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nBased on the speakers at the 2018 UK's Flat Earth UK Convention, believers in a flat Earth vary widely in their views. While most agree upon a disc-shaped Earth, some are convinced the Earth is diamond-shaped. Furthermore, while most believers do not believe in outer space and none believe humans have ever travelled there, they vary widely in their views of the universe. (Flat Earth International Conferences, organized by Robbie Davidson, are unaffiliated with the Flat Earth Society. According to Davidson, the \"Earth is ... a stationary plane, with the sun, moon, and stars inside a dome\", while the Flat Earth Society promotes a model in which Earth is \"a disk flying through space\", and which Davidson finds \"incredibly ridiculous\".)\nFilmmakers of Behind the Curve attended another flat Earth conference at which a substantial number of people believed the Earth was an infinite plane, potentially with more continents beyond the purported circular ice wall of Antarctica. \nMembers of the Flat Earth Society and other flat-Earthers claim that NASA and other government agencies conspire to fabricate evidence that the Earth is spherical. According to the most widely spread version of current flat-Earth theory, NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall that surrounds Earth. Flat-Earthers argue that NASA manipulates and fabricates its satellite images, based on observations that the color of the oceans changes from image to image and that continents seem to be in different places. The publicly perpetuated image is kept up through a large-scale practice of \"compartmentalization\", according to which only a select number of individuals have knowledge about the truth.\nResearch by Carlos Diaz Ruiz and Tomas Nilsson on the arguments that flat Earthers wield, shows three factions, each one subscribing to its own set of beliefs.\nThe first faction subscribes to a faith-based conflict in which atheists use science to suppress the Christian faith. Their argument is that atheists use pseudo-science – evolution, Big Bang, and the round Earth – to make people believe that God is an abstract idea, not real. Instead, their arguments use the Scripture – word-by-word – to support an argument that enables God to really exist. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as revelatory. (For example, a literal interpretation of Revelation 7 --  \"I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth ...\"—indicates the earth must have four corners.) This is in spite of the fact that a circular flat earth would also not have corners, contradicting the central model of flat earth. This contradiction seems to imply that god created a 2D quadrilateral or 3D tetrahedral earth. \nThe second faction believes in an overarching conspiracy for knowledge suppression. Building upon the premise that knowledge is power, the flat Earth conspiracy argues that a shadowy group of \"elites\" control knowledge to remain in power. In their view, lying about the fundamental nature of the Earth primes the population to believe a host of other conspiracies. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as liberatory.\nThe third faction believes that knowledge is personal and experiential. They are dismissive of knowledge that comes from authoritative sources, especially book knowledge. This faction would like to find out themselves whether the Earth truly is round or flat. Because they distrust book knowledge and mathematical proof, this faction believes that the Earth is flat because their observations and lived experiences make it appear as if we live on a flat surface. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as experimental.\nFellow flat earthers are not exempt from distrust and belief that they may be in cahoots with round earthers.  In Behind the Curve, conference attendees were warned against attending by Math Powerland a.k.a. Matt Boylan, who posted videos alleging others were working for the CIA or Warner Brothers. At the 2017 Flat Earth conference:\n\n[S]everal speakers made reference to \"shills\" within the community, people purporting to espouse the theory but who in fact belong to some deep-state counterintelligence program aimed at making the movement seem laughable. In 2016, [Eric Dubay], of the \"200 Proofs\" video, called out Mark Sargent, Jeran Campanella, and other figures as \"suspected controlled opposition shills,\" and last year in a radio interview he called the November conference a \"shill-fest.\" Even the flat-Earth bureaucracy is suspect. At the end of the conference's second day, a panelist mentioned a plan to set up a nonprofit to carry on the work. This brought a rebuke from a woman in the audience. \"You had me up until I heard the gentleman say, 'The reason we had to scramble to get the 501(c)(3),'\" she said. \"In my research, I found out that's a Luciferian contract.\"\n\n\n=== Social and experimental activities of skeptics and believers ===\nOrganisations sceptical of fringe beliefs have occasionally performed tests to demonstrate the local curvature of the Earth. One of these, conducted by members of the Independent Investigations Group of the Center for Inquiry, at the Salton Sea on 10 June 2018 was attended also by supporters of a flat Earth, and the encounter between the two groups was recorded by the National Geographic Explorer. This experiment successfully demonstrated the curvature of the Earth via the disappearance over distance of boat-based and shore-based targets. IIG founder Jim Underdown reported that the flat Earth supporters in attendance immediately rejected the results, denying the validity of the demonstration after the fact, and the discussion degenerated into tangents about Moon landing conspiracy theories and alleged NASA cover-ups.\nThe 2018 documentary Behind the Curve followed two groups of American flat Earth believers who were attempting to gather first-hand empirical proof for that belief. One group from the YouTube show GlobeBusters used a ring laser gyroscope in an attempt to show the Earth was not rotating. Instead, they detected the actual 15-degree-per-hour rotation of the Earth, a measurement they dismissed as corrupted by the device somehow picking up the rotation of the \"firmament\". Another group used lasers in an attempt to show a several-mile stretch of water is perfectly flat by measuring the distance between the water level and the laser beam along three vertical posts. They were unable to align the beam as they expected to because the surface of the still water was in fact bent by several feet over the distance measured; the experiment was dismissed as inconclusive.\nBehind the Curve illustrated how flat Earth believers rely on poorly-verified claims. Mark Sargent claimed to have watched flightaware.com for a very long time to check if any flights traveled between continents in the Southern Hemisphere, which in his disc model would be much further apart than they are on the globe. He stated that he saw no such flights, and took this as evidence for the disc model. Caltech astrophysicist Hannalore Gerling-Dunsmore went to the site and immediately found flights that contradicted Sargent's claims.\nThe solar eclipse of 21 August 2017 gave rise to numerous YouTube videos purporting to show how the details of the eclipse prove the Earth is flat.\nIn 2017, \"the Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational world\" had a scandal when a Ph.D. student at the University of Sfax in Tunisia submitted a Ph.D. dissertation \"declaring Earth to be flat, unmoving, young (only 13,500 years of age), and the centre of the universe\".  In 2018, astronomer Yaël Nazé analyzed the controversy over the dissertation.  The dissertation, which had not been approved by the committee overseeing environmental studies theses, had been made public and denounced in 2017 by Hafedh Ateb, a founder of the Tunisian Astronomical Society, on his Facebook page.\nIn March 2019, social media personality Logan Paul released a satirical documentary film about the flat Earth called FLAT EARTH: To The Edge And Back.\nOn December 14, 2024, retired businessman and pastor Will Duffy paid to bring believers in the concept of a flat earth to Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica for them to witness day-long illumination. While his guests had to concede they witnessed the midnight sun in Antarctica, not all of them accepted on the spot that the Earth is a sphere.\n\n\n==== Mike Hughes ====\n\nMike Hughes, a daredevil/stuntman, planned to use a homebuilt crewed rocket to reach outer space.\nIn a practice flight on 22 February 2020, the early deployment and separation of the return parachute allowed his rocket to fall unimpeded from an altitude of several hundred feet, killing him instantly.\nAfter Hughes' death, his public relations representative Darren Shuster stated that Hughes \"didn't believe in flat Earth\" and that it was \"a PR stunt\" to get publicity, while Michael Linn, who worked on the documentary Rocketman: Mad Mike's Mission to Prove the Flat-Earth, said that Hughes' belief appeared genuine.\n\n\n=== Social consequences and responses ===\nBehind the Curve's filmmakers spoke with several people who said that as a result of their flat Earth beliefs they had lost romantic partners and no longer spoke to many friends and family. One said he was tired of being told he was an idiot. The Facebook group Flat Earth Match is a dating site used by some to find romantic partners who share these beliefs. Experts pointed out that after social ties to people outside the flat Earth community are lost, one consequence of abandoning the flat Earth belief would be loss of all remaining relationships.\nCaltech physicist Spiros Michaelakis stated that instead of denigrating flat Earthers, scientists should do a better job of teaching scientific facts. Various scientific and medical experts in the documentary supported improving scientific literacy and avoiding marginalization of flat Earthers. They pointed out that people who distrust all of science, including truths about vaccines, evolution, and climate change, would make poorly informed-decisions, and that people who do not exercise the skill of critical thinking can be easily manipulated. They also pointed out that some believers were motivated to spread false ideas, and that because they are unconstrained by facts they can mutate and become less harmless than a mere belief about the shape of the Earth.\n\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nIn 2020, it was reported that based on polling by Datafolha, 7% of Brazilians believed in a flat Earth. A 2018 YouGov poll found that around 4% of the population of the United States believed in flat Earth, while the POLES 2021 Survey found around 10% of the United States population believed that the Earth is flat. A 2019 YouGov survey found that around 3% of British people supported flat Earth.\n\n\n== The term \"flat-Earther\" ==\nThe term flat-Earth-man, used in a derogatory sense to mean anyone who holds ridiculously antiquated or impossible views, predates the more compact flat-earther.  It was recorded in 1908: \"Fewer votes than one would have thought possible for any human candidate, were he even a flat-earth-man.\" According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first use of the term flat-Earther was in 1934 in Punch magazine: \"Without being a bigoted flat-earther, [Mercator] perceived the nuisance ... of fiddling about with globes ... in order to discover the South Seas.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEmpirical evidence for the spherical shape of Earth\nFigure of the Earth\nGeodesy\nHollow Earth\nCategory:Flat Earth proponents\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\nGarwood, Christine (2007).

        "title": "NESARA",
        "wikipedia_content": "The National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) is a set of proposed economic reforms for the United States suggested during the 1990s by private citizen Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress.\nSince the early 2000s, NESARA has become better known as the subject of a cult-like conspiracy theory whose original promoter was Internet personality Shaini Candace Goodwin, better known as \"Dove of Oneness\". Goodwin, who appropriated the NESARA notions without Barnard's consent, claimed that the act was actually passed with additional provisions as the National Economic Security and Reformation Act, and then suppressed by the George W. Bush administration and the Supreme Court. Goodwin's conspiracy emails were translated into several languages and had a large following online. Adherents to the theory have also been using the name GESARA (standing either for  Global Economic Security and Recovery Act  or Global Economic Security and Reformation Act) in order to extend the proposed NESARA reforms outside the US and to the rest of the world.\n\n\n== Monetary reform proposal ==\nHarvey Francis Barnard (1941–2005), an engineering consultant and teacher with a PhD in systems theory, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Barnard printed 1,000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one \"moral evil\" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After Barnard's efforts to gain political support did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release his proposal to the public domain and publish it on the Internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the second edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theory ==\n\n\n=== Dove of Oneness ===\nSoon after Barnard released NESARA on the Internet, a user known as \"Dove of Oneness\" began posting about it in forums and eventually created a website devoted to it. \"Dove of Oneness\" was later identified as Shaini Candace Goodwin, a former student of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. Goodwin claimed that the NESARA bill languished in Congress before finally being passed by a secret session in March 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. Her theory held that the new law was to be implemented at 10 a.m. on September 11, 2001, but that the computers, and data of the beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars of \"Prosperity funds\", were destroyed on the second floor of one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City during the terrorist attacks.  Supposedly an earlier gag order issued by the Supreme Court had prohibited any official or private source from discussing it, under penalty of death. Goodwin referred to \"White Knights,\" most of them high-ranking military officials, who have since been struggling to have the law implemented despite opposition by President George W. Bush. Goodwin purported that Bush orchestrated the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War as distractions from NESARA. \nGoodwin's description of NESARA goes far beyond Barnard's proposal by cancelling all personal debts, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, declaring world peace, and requiring new presidential and congressional elections. Goodwin often claimed that the Bush administration was attempting to hack into and bring down her web site to prevent her from publicizing the law. She would purport to be connected with powerful officials and used authoritative language, publishing messages in which she \"ordered\" the \"White Knights\" to enforce NESARA.\nGoodwin began commenting on NESARA in connection with Omega Trust, a fraudulent investment scheme whose creator, Clyde Hood, was on trial at the time. According to Goodwin, Omega Trust investors would receive their returns after NESARA was announced. Goodwin repeatedly predicted that the NESARA announcement would occur in the very near future, although in later years she became more reserved in these predictions. \nBarnard became aware of Goodwin's description of NESARA before his death in 2005. He denied that NESARA had been enacted into law or even assigned a tracking number, and condemned Goodwin's allegations as a disinformation campaign.  \nGoodwin promoted the NESARA theory until her death in 2010.\n\n\n=== Further developments ===\nAfter Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other Internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and \"interdimensional\" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Late Internet conspiracy theorist Sherry Shriner, who operated multiple websites, saw NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she asserted long controlled the U.S. government.\nSome NESARA supporters also make the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a \"channeled\" cosmic being called \"Hatonn\" (an android Pleiadean), and another named \"Sananda\". According to some proponents of Ascended Master Teachings, such as Joshua David Stone, Sheldan Nidle, and Luis Prada, \"Sananda\" is the \"galactic name\" of Ascended Master Jesus, which he uses in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Ashtar Command flying saucer fleet. \"Pallas Athena\" is regarded as being the Vice-Commander of the saucer fleet. Ashtar (Ashtar Sheran) is regarded in these teachings as being third-in-command.  The designation of George W. Bush as a disguised reptilian often co-occurred with this claim. Goodwin has claimed that Ascended Master Saint Germain came down from the etheric plane to physically meet with heads of banks and world leaders regarding the NESARA announcement.\nFollowers of the NESARA conspiracy theory began using the name \"GESARA\" in the mid-2010s, by referencing the set of reforms as a \"Global\" - and not \"National\" - Economic Security and Reformation Act. They notably claimed that several East Asian groups were involved in enforcing the reforms worldwide, including the purported \"White Dragon Society\" which would benefit from fundings by \"the successors of the last Chinese Emperor, Pu Yi\". One prominent advocate of \"GESARA\" has been a blogger based in the UK and going by the name \"Alcuin Bramerton\". In 2020, \"Bramerton\" asserted that the \"NESARA global prosperity programmes\" were about to be announced and activated through an entity called the \"Saint Germain World Trust\" which would provide \"one quattuordecillion US dollars\" to \"zero out (permanently cancel) all personal, corporate and national debts worldwide\" and that further money would be provided to the \"White Dragon Society\" by the \"Manchu family syndicate\".\nNESARA groups are known for certain to exist and to have attracted press attention in Utah, and the Netherlands. Members of these groups get together to discuss the status of NESARA, read the various reports, hold protests, and pass out fliers about NESARA to the public. Goodwin claimed that NESARA groups exist throughout several nations and US states including California, Washington, Arizona, and Texas, and provides hundreds of pieces of photographic evidence of people in public protests holding NESARA banners, but it is not clear to what degree the people holding the banners are aware of what NESARA is, or for how long these groups were active. The News Tribune has traced the story behind at least some of these photos (photos of trucks driving around Washington, D.C. bearing the words \"NESARA Announcement Now!\"), and found that they were part of a $40,000 advertising campaign allegedly paid for by an elderly San Francisco resident who had made donations to Goodwin. \nNESARA's concepts have also been incorporated by other conspiracy theories. In 2022, Bellingcat compared NESARA/GESARA to a \"grandfather\" of QAnon and reported that as QAnon's iconography and concepts were declining in popularity, its adherents were becoming more and more invested in NESARA concepts and reviving that older movement. People involved with the sovereign citizen movement have also subscribed to NESARA-related theories.\n\n\n=== Comparison to a cult and scam accusations ===\nCritics consider NESARA to be a cult. Pointing to the fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently solicited donations from their readers, they accuse these leaders of being primarily interested in securing a steady stream of income for themselves. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced. In 2004, The News Tribune published an article which called Goodwin a \"cybercult queen\" and described the NESARA phenomenon as a scam.\nA June 2006 complaint to the Washington consumer protection division accused Goodwin of using the NESARA story to defraud a 64-year-old San Francisco woman of at least $10,000. The woman's daughter said the actual amount is much larger, in the hundreds of thousands.\nThe prominence of failed prophecy also lends support to the cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is going to happen in a matter of days. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFairTax\nRedemption movement\nSwissindo\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGulyas, Aaron John (2021).

        "title": "Simulation hypothesis",
        "wikipedia_content": "The simulation hypothesis proposes that what one experiences as the world is actually a simulated reality, such as a computer simulation in which we ourselves are constructs. There has been much debate over this topic in the philosophical discourse, and regarding practical applications in computing.\nIn 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed the simulation argument, which suggests that if a civilization becomes capable of creating conscious simulations, it could generate so many simulated beings that a randomly chosen conscious entity would almost certainly be in a simulation. The argument presents a trilemma: either such simulations are not created due to technological limitations or self-destruction; or advanced civilizations choose not to create them; or we are almost certainly living in one. This assumes that consciousness is not uniquely tied to biological brains but can arise from any system that implements the right computational structures and processes.\nThe hypothesis is preceded by many earlier versions, and variations on the idea have also been featured in science fiction, appearing as a central plot device in many stories and films, such as The Matrix (1999).\n\n\n== Origins ==\nHuman history is full of thinkers who observed the difference between how things seem and how they might actually be, with dreams, illusions, and hallucinations providing poetic and philosophical metaphors. For example, the \"Butterfly Dream\" of Zhuangzi from ancient China, or the Indian philosophy of Maya, or in ancient Greek philosophy—Anaxarchus and Monimus likened existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.\nAztec philosophical texts theorized that the world was a painting or book written by the Teotl.\nIn the Western philosophical tradition, Plato's allegory of the cave, presented in the 4th century BCE, stands out as an influential example.\nRené Descartes' evil demon philosophically formalized these epistemic doubts, to be followed by a large literature with subsequent variations like brain in a vat.\nIn 1969, Konrad Zuse published his book Calculating Space on automata theory, in which he proposes the idea that the universe is fundamentally computational, a concept which became known as digital physics. \n\n\n== Simulation argument ==\n\nNick Bostrom's premise:\n\nMany works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race.\nBostrom's conclusion:\n\nIt is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones.\nTherefore, if we don't think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears.\n\n\n=== Expanded argument ===\nBostrom attempted to assess the probability of our reality being a simulation. His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:\n\nHuman civilization or a comparable civilization is unlikely to reach a level of technological maturity capable of producing simulated realities, or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.\nA comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of \"real\" entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.\nAny entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.\nHumans are living in a reality in which post-humans have not developed yet, and current humans are actually living in reality.\nHumans will have no way of knowing that they live in a simulation because they will never reach the technological capacity to realize the marks of a simulated reality.\nBostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.\nFirst, if one assumes that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.\nEpistemologically, it is not impossible for humans to tell whether they are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: \"You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information\". However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.\nIn 2003, Bostrom proposed a trilemma that he called \"the simulation argument\". Despite its name, the \"simulation argument\" does not directly argue that humans live in a simulation; instead, it argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true:\n\n\"The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero\", or\n\"The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running simulations of their evolutionary history, or variations thereof, is very close to zero\", or\n\"The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one\".\nThe trilemma points out that a technologically mature \"posthuman\" civilization would have enormous computing power; if even a tiny percentage of them were to run \"ancestor simulations\" (that is, \"high-fidelity\" simulations of ancestral life that would be indistinguishable from reality to the simulated ancestor), the total number of simulated ancestors, or \"Sims\", in the universe (or multiverse, if it exists) would greatly exceed the total number of actual ancestors.\nBostrom goes on to use a type of anthropic reasoning to claim that, if the third proposition is the one of those three that is true, and almost all people live in simulations, then humans are almost certainly living in a simulation.\nBostrom claims his argument goes beyond the classical ancient \"skeptical hypothesis\", claiming that \"... we have interesting empirical reasons to believe that a certain disjunctive claim about the world is true\", the third of the three disjunctive propositions being that humans are almost certainly living in a simulation. Thus, Bostrom, and writers in agreement with Bostrom such as David Chalmers, argue there might be empirical reasons for the \"simulation hypothesis\", and that therefore the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis but rather a \"metaphysical hypothesis\". Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument as to which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: \"If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility #n that obtains.' But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true\".\nAs a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that \"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation\".\n\n\n=== Criticism of Bostrom's anthropic reasoning ===\n\nBostrom argues that if \"the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one\", then it follows that humans probably live in a simulation. Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps \"Sims\" do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim. Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting \"neural ancestor simulations\" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's \"ancestor simulations\", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation exists.\nThe hypothesis has received criticism from some physicists, such as Sabine Hossenfelder, who considers that it is physically impossible to simulate the universe without producing measurable inconsistencies, and called it pseudoscience and religion. Cosmologist George F. R. Ellis, who stated that \"[the hypothesis] is totally impracticable from a technical viewpoint\", and that \"late-night pub discussion is not a viable theory\". Some scholars categorically reject—or are uninterested in—anthropic reasoning, dismissing it as \"merely philosophical\", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific.\nSome critics propose that the simulation could be in the first generation, and all the simulated people that will one day be created do not yet exist, in accordance with philosophical presentism.\nThe cosmologist Sean M. Carroll argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if humans are typical, as it is assumed, and not capable of performing simulations, this contradicts the arguer's assumption that it is easy for us to foresee that other civilizations can most likely perform simulations.\nPhysicist Frank Wilczek raises an empirical objection, saying that the laws of the universe have hidden complexity which is \"not used for anything\" and the laws are constrained by time and location – all of this being unnecessary and extraneous in a simulation. He further argues that the simulation argument amounts to \"begging the question,\" due to the \"embarrassing question\" of the nature of the underlying reality in which this universe is simulated. \"Okay if this is a simulated world, what is the thing in which it is simulated made out of? What are the laws for that?\"\nBrian Eggleston has argued that the future humans of our universe cannot be the ones performing the simulation, since the simulation argument considers our universe to be the one being simulated. In other words, it has been argued that the probability that humans live in a simulated universe is not independent of the prior probability that is assigned to the existence of other universes.\n\n\n=== Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis ===\n\nSome scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that humans live in a simulation) is false. Physicist Paul Davies uses Bostrom's trilemma as part of one possible argument against a near-infinite multiverse. This argument runs as follows: if there were a near-infinite multiverse, there would be posthuman civilizations running ancestor simulations, which would lead to the untenable and scientifically self-defeating conclusion that humans live in a simulation; therefore, by reductio ad absurdum, existing multiverse theories are likely false. (Unlike Bostrom and Chalmers, Davies (among others) considers the simulation hypothesis to be self-defeating.)\nSome point out that there is currently no proof of technology that would facilitate the existence of sufficiently high-fidelity ancestor simulation. Additionally, there is no proof that it is physically possible or feasible for a posthuman civilization to create such a simulation, and therefore for the present, the first proposition must be taken to be true. Additionally there are limits of computation.\nPhysicist Marcelo Gleiser objects to the notion that posthumans would have a reason to run simulated universes:  \"...being so advanced they would have collected enough knowledge about their past to have little interest in this kind of simulation. ...They may have virtual-reality museums, where they could go and experience the lives and tribulations of their ancestors. But a full-fledged, resource-consuming simulation of an entire universe? Sounds like a colossal waste of time\". Gleiser also points out that there is no plausible reason to stop at one level of simulation, so that the simulated ancestors might also be simulating their ancestors, and so on, creating an infinite regress akin to the \"problem of the First Cause\".\nIn 2019, philosopher Preston Greene suggested that it may be best not to find out if we are living in a simulation, since, if it were found to be true, such knowing might end the simulation.\nEconomist Robin Hanson argues that a self-interested occupant of a high-fidelity simulation should strive to be entertaining and praiseworthy in order to avoid being turned off or being shunted into a non-conscious low-fidelity part of the simulation. Hanson additionally speculates that someone who is aware that he might be in a simulation might care less about others and live more for today: \"your motivation to save for retirement, or to help the poor in Ethiopia, might be muted by realizing that in your simulation, you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia\".\nBesides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in metaphysics and epistemology. David Chalmers has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their mental lives are governed by the physics of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics). Chalmers claims that they might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically caused, and argues that this means that Cartesian dualism is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it. Similar arguments have been made for philosophical views about personal identity that say that an individual could have been another human being in the past, as well as views about qualia that say that colors could have appeared differently than they do (the inverted spectrum scenario). In both cases, the claim is that all this would require is hooking up the mental lives to the simulated physics in a different way.\n\n\n=== Computationalism ===\n\nComputationalism is a philosophy of mind theory stating that cognition is a form of computation. It is relevant to the simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a \"virtual people\" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal qualia of consciousness is disputed. It is possible that consciousness requires a vital substrate that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies. This would undermine Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; humans cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as humans understand it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and humans could still be vatted brains, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).\nSome theorists have argued that if the \"consciousness-is-computation\" version of computationalism and mathematical realism (or radical mathematical Platonism) are true, then consciousness is computation, which in principle is platform independent and thus admits of simulation. This argument states that a \"Platonic realm\" or ultimate ensemble would contain every algorithm, including those that implement consciousness. Hans Moravec has explored the simulation hypothesis and has argued for a kind of mathematical Platonism according to which every object (including, for example, a stone) can be regarded as implementing every possible computation.\n\n\n== In physics ==\nIn physics, the view of the universe and its workings as the ebb and flow of information was first observed by Wheeler. Consequently, two views of the world emerged: the first one proposes that the universe is a quantum computer, while the other one proposes that the system performing the simulation is distinct from its simulation (the universe). Of the former view, quantum-computing specialist Dave Bacon wrote:\n\nIn many respects this point of view may be nothing more than a result of the fact that the notion of computation is the disease of our age—everywhere we look today we see examples of computers, computation, and information theory and thus we extrapolate this to our laws of physics. Indeed, thinking about computing as arising from faulty components, it seems as if the abstraction that uses perfectly operating computers is unlikely to exist as anything but a platonic ideal. Another critique of such a point of view is that there is no evidence for the kind of digitization that characterizes computers nor are there any predictions made by those who advocate such a view that have been experimentally confirmed.\n\n\n=== Testing the hypothesis physically ===\nA method to test one type of simulation hypothesis was proposed in 2012 in a joint paper by physicists Silas R. Beane from the University of Bonn (now at the University of Washington, Seattle), and Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage from the University of Washington, Seattle. Under the assumption of finite computational resources, the simulation of the universe would be performed by dividing the space-time continuum into a discrete set of points, which may result in observable effects. In analogy with the mini-simulations that lattice-gauge theorists run today to build up nuclei from the underlying theory of strong interactions (known as quantum chromodynamics), several observational consequences of a grid-like space-time have been studied in their work. Among proposed signatures is an anisotropy in the distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays that, if observed, would be consistent with the simulation hypothesis according to these physicists. In 2017, Campbell et al. proposed several experiments aimed at testing the simulation hypothesis in their paper \"On Testing the Simulation Theory\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAstrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson said in a 2018 NBC News interview that he estimated the likelihood of the simulation hypothesis being correct at \"better than 50-50 odds\", adding \"I wish I could summon a strong argument against it, but I can find none\". However, in a subsequent interview with Chuck Nice on a YouTube episode of StarTalk, Tyson shared that his friend J. Richard Gott, a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University, made him aware of a strong objection to the simulation hypothesis. The objection claims that the common trait that all hypothetical high-fidelity simulated universes possess is the ability to produce high-fidelity simulated universes. And since our current world does not possess this ability, it would mean that either humans are in the real universe, and therefore simulated universes have not yet been created, or that humans are the last in a very long chain of simulated universes, an observation that makes the simulation hypothesis seem less probable. Regarding this objection, Tyson remarked \"that changes my life\".\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, stated that the argument for the simulation theory is \"quite strong\". In a podcast with Joe Rogan, Musk said \"If you assume any rate of improvement at all, games will eventually be indistinguishable from reality\" before concluding \"that it's most likely we're in a simulation\". At various other press conferences and events, Musk has also speculated that the likelihood of us living in a simulated reality or computer made by others is about 99.9%, and stated in a 2016 interview that he believed there was \"a one in billion chance we're in base reality\".\nRizwan Virk, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a founder of PlayLabs, and author of the book, \"The Simulation Hypothesis\". A story about Virk trying on a virtual reality headset and forgetting he was in an empty room makes him wonder if the real world was created by more tech-savvy individuals, other than us.\n\n\n== Other uses in philosophy ==\n\n\n=== Dream argument ===\n\nThere is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion. This skeptical hypothesis can be traced back to antiquity; for example, to the \"Butterfly Dream\" of Zhuangzi, or the Indian philosophy of Maya, or in Ancient Greek philosophy Anaxarchus and Monimus likened existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.\nA dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result, Bertrand Russell has argued that the \"dream hypothesis\" is not a logical impossibility, but that common sense as well as considerations of simplicity and inference to the best explanation rule against it.  One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between reality and dreams was Zhuangzi, a Chinese philosopher of the 4th century BC.  He phrased the problem as the well-known \"Butterfly Dream,\" which went as follows:\n\nOnce Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)\nThe philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by Descartes, who was one of the first Western philosophers to do so. In Meditations on First Philosophy, he states \"... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep\", and goes on to conclude that \"It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false\".\nChalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:\n\nthat he is currently dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;\nthat he has always been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination.\nBoth the dream argument and the simulation hypothesis can be regarded as skeptical hypotheses. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is psychosis, though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.\nIn On Certainty, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has argued that such skeptical hypothesis are unsinnig (i.e. non-sensical), as they doubt knowledge that is required in order to make sense of the hypotheses themselves.\nThe dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's personal horizon: what this world would be internal to if this were all a dream.\nLucid dreaming is characterized as an idea where the elements of dreaming and waking are combined to a point where the user knows they are dreaming, or waking perhaps.\n\n\n=== Modern philosophy ===\nA version of the simulation hypothesis was theorized as a part of a philosophical argument on the part of René Descartes, by George Berkeley (1685–1753) with his \"immaterialism\" (later referred to as subjective idealism by others), and later by Hans Moravec. \n\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) and his evil demon concept, sometimes also called his 'evil genius' concept\nAztec philosophical texts theorized that the world was a painting or book written by the Teotl.\nNietzsche, in Beyond Good and Evil chastised philosophers for seeking to find the true world behind the deceptive world of appearances.\nIt is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world.... Why might not the world which concerns us⁠—be a fiction?\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nScience fiction has highlighted themes such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer gaming for more than fifty years. \nSimulacron-3 (1964) by Daniel F. Galouye (alternative title: Counterfeit World) tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes, in which the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world. The book was made into a German made-for-TV film called World on a Wire (1973) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and aired on ARD. The film The Thirteenth Floor (1999) was also loosely based on both this book and World on a Wire. \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" is a short story by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in April 1966, and was the basis for the 1990 film Total Recall and its 2012 remake. In Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, a short story made into a 1983 television film, the main character pays to have his mind connected to a simulation.\nThe same theme was repeated in the 1999 film The Matrix, which depicted a world in which artificially intelligent robots enslaved humanity within a simulation set in the contemporary world. The 2012 play World of Wires was partially inspired by the Bostrom essay on the simulation hypothesis.\nThe 2012 visual novel Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is set in a simulated reality known as the Neo World Program, which in this instance simulates a class trip to Jabberwock Island which, while initially peaceful, turns into a \"killing game\" involving the students in the simulation killing each other and trying to not be found guilty. Similarly, 2022's Anonymous;Code explores the idea of the world being a simulation, with an infinite or near-infinite number of \"world layers\" of simulations running inside other simulations. The main problem with this system is that in some of these \"world layers\", both above and below the one the characters find themselves living in, the Year 2038 Problem has not been solved, dooming the world to end on January 19, 2038 at 3:14:07 am UTC. The characters have to hack all the way into the highest world layer, the real world that the player lives in, to synchronize all the world layers and solve the Year 2038 problem in all of them.\nThe 2014 episode of the animated sitcom Rick and Morty, \"M. Night Shaym-Aliens!\", demonstrates a low-quality simulation that attempts to trap the two titular protagonists, but because the operation is less \"realistic\" than typically operated \"reality\", it becomes obvious.\nIn 2015, Kent Forbes published a documentary named \"The Simulation Hypothesis\", notably featuring Max Tegmark, Neil degrasse Tyson, Paul Davies and James Gates.\nIn the 2016 video game No Man's Sky, the universe is a simulated universe run by The Atlas. According to in-game lore, many vastly different iterations of the universe existed, with very different histories and races. As the Atlas AI became more and more corrupted, the universes became more and more similar to each other. \nA 2017 episode of the long-running British science fiction series Doctor Who titled \"Extremis\" features a simulated version of the Twelfth Doctor and his companions. A secret Vatican document describes the truth about the simulated reality by inviting its reader to choose any series of numbers at random. The document lists the same numbers on the next page since the simulated program cannot produce a truly random event. The simulation is finally revealed to be a practice world for aliens intent on real-world domination.\nThe 2022 Netflix epic period mystery-science fiction 1899 created by Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar tells the unfinished story of a simulation scenario in which multiple persons find themselves in a circumstance of multiplicities and simultaneities. The storyline involves an amnesia, seemingly to protect the integrity of the simulation, as suggested would be necessary by the philosopher Preston Green.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCopleston, Frederick (1993) [1946]. \"XIX Theory of Knowledge\".

        "title": "Bilderberg Meeting",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Bilderberg Meeting (also known as the \"Bilderberg Group\", \"Bilderberg Conference\" or \"Bilderberg Club\") is an annual off-the-record forum established in 1954 to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. The group's agenda, originally to prevent another world war, is now defined as bolstering a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe. Participants include political leaders, experts, captains of industry, finance, academia, numbering between 120 and 150. Attendees are entitled to use information gained at meetings, but not attribute it to a named speaker (known as the Chatham House Rule). The group states that the purpose of this is to encourage candid debate while at the same time maintaining privacy, but critics from a wide range of viewpoints have called it into question, and it has provoked conspiracy theories from both the left and right.\nMeetings were chaired by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands until 1975. The current Chairman is French businessman Henri de Castries. Since 1954, the meeting has taken place every year except in 1976, when it was cancelled due to the Lockheed bribery scandals involving Prince Bernhard, and in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lisbon hosted the 69th meeting in 2023.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe first conference was held at the Bilderberg Hotel (Hotel de Bilderberg) in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, from 29 to 31 May 1954. The hotel gave its name both to the group and to the \"Bilderbergers\" who participate in its activities. The hotel is situated in a quiet location, approximately 7 km west of the city of Arnhem. It is owned and operated by the Bilderberg hotel chain, which runs 12 hotels and an event location in the Netherlands and one hotel in Germany. At the time of the 1954 conference, it was a medium-sized family-run hotel.\nThe conference was initiated by several people, including Polish politician-in-exile Józef Retinger who, concerned about the growth of anti-Americanism in Western Europe, proposed an international conference at which leaders from European countries and the United States would be brought together with the aim of promoting Atlanticism—better understanding between the cultures of the United States and Western Europe to foster cooperation on political, economic, and defense issues.\nRetinger approached Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who agreed to promote the idea, together with former Belgian prime minister Paul van Zeeland, and the then head of Unilever, Paul Rijkens. Bernhard in turn contacted Walter Bedell Smith, the then head of the CIA, who asked Eisenhower adviser Charles Douglas Jackson to deal with the suggestion. The guest list was to be drawn up by inviting two attendees from each nation, one of each to represent \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" points of view. Fifty delegates from 11 countries in Western Europe attended the first conference, along with 11 Americans.\nThe success of the meeting led the organizers to arrange an annual conference. A permanent steering committee was established with Retinger appointed as permanent secretary. As well as organizing the conference, the steering committee also maintained a register of attendee names and contact details with the aim of creating an informal network of individuals who could call upon one another in a private capacity. Conferences were held in France, Germany, and Denmark over the following three years. In 1957, the first U.S. conference was held on St. Simons Island, Georgia, with $30,000 from the Ford Foundation. The foundation also supplied funding for the 1959 and 1963 conferences.\n\n\n== Participants ==\n\nThe participants are between 120 and 150 people, including political leaders, experts from industry, finance, NATO, academia and the media. About two thirds of the participants come from Europe and the rest from North America; one third from politics and government and the rest from other fields. Historically, attendee lists have been weighted toward bankers, politicians, directors of large businesses and board members from large publicly traded corporations, including Wallenberg-owned conglomerate holding company Investor AB and other Wallenberg-owned multinationals such as Ericsson and ABB, IBM, Xerox, Royal Dutch Shell, Nokia and Daimler. Heads of state, including former King Juan Carlos I of Spain and former Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, have attended meetings. A source connected to the group told The Daily Telegraph in 2013 that other individuals, whose names are not publicly issued, sometimes turn up \"just for the day\" at the group's meetings.\nThe banker and industrialist Marcus Wallenberg Jr. was a member of the steering committee and attended the meeting twenty-two times from the 1950s to 1981, a year prior to his death. His grandson Marcus Wallenberg has attended it eight times and his other grandson, Jacob Wallenberg, seventeen times.\n\n\n== Meetings ==\n\n\n== Activities and goals ==\nThe group's original goal of promoting Atlanticism, strengthening U.S.-European relations, and preventing another world war has grown. According to Andrew Kakabadse, the Bilderberg Group's theme is to \"bolster a consensus around free-market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe\". In 2001, Denis Healey, a Bilderberg group founder and a steering committee member for 30 years, said, \"To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.\"\nAccording to the web page of the group, the meetings are conducted under the Chatham House Rule, allowing the participants to use any information they gained during the meeting, but not to disclose the names of the speakers or any other participants. According to former chairman Étienne Davignon in 2011, a major attraction of Bilderberg group meetings is that they provide an opportunity for participants to speak and debate candidly and to find out what major figures really think, without the risk of off-the-cuff comments becoming fodder for controversy in the media. A 2008 press release from the \"American Friends of Bilderberg\" stated that \"Bilderberg's only activity is its annual Conference and that at the meetings, no resolutions were proposed, no votes taken, and no policy statements issued.\" However, in November 2009, the group hosted a dinner meeting at the Château of Val-Duchesse in Brussels outside its annual conference to promote the candidacy of Herman Van Rompuy for President of the European Council.\n\n\n== Organizational structure ==\nMeetings are organized by a steering committee with two members from each of approximately 18 nations. Official posts include a chairman and an Honorary Secretary General. The group's rules do not contain a membership category but former participants receive the annual conference reports. The only category that exists is \"member of the steering committee\". Besides the committee, there is a separate advisory group with overlapping membership.\nDutch economist Ernst van der Beugel became permanent secretary in 1960, upon Retinger's death. Prince Bernhard continued to serve as the meeting's chairman until 1976, the year of his involvement in the Lockheed affair. The position of Honorary American Secretary General has been held successively by Joseph E. Johnson of the Carnegie Endowment; William Bundy of Princeton University; Theodore L. Eliot Jr., former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan; and Casimir A. Yost of Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.\nAccording to James A. Bill, the \"steering committee usually met twice a year to plan programs and to discuss the participant list\".\nIn 2002, in Them: Adventures with Extremists, author Jon Ronson wrote that the group has a small central office in Holland which each year decides what country will host the forthcoming meeting. The host country then has to book an entire hotel for four days, plus arrange catering, transport and security. To fund this, the host solicits donations from sympathetic corporations such as Barclays, Fiat Automobiles, GlaxoSmithKline, Heinz, Nokia and Xerox.\n\n\n== Chairmen of the Steering Committee ==\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThere have been long standing concerns about lobbying, since senior policymakers meet with corporate lobbyists, and in the case of the 2015 meeting even with senior figures at Transparency International.\nPartly because of its working methods to ensure strict privacy and secrecy, the Bilderberg Group has been criticised for its lack of transparency and accountability. \nIan Richardson sees Bilderberg as the transnational power elite, \"an integral, and to some extent critical, part of the existing system of global governance\", that is \"not acting in the interests of the whole\". Many of these critics have emphasized that they do not accept or do not believe that there is enough evidence to support the diversity of conspiracy theories that have arisen in regard to the group and that they disapprove of what they regard as their unpleasant associations and connotations. For example, an article by the English commentator Charlie Skelton in The Guardian in June 2017 criticized the world view expressed in an agenda published by the Bilderberg group without engaging in speculation about conspiratorial activities.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\nThe secrecy of the proceedings has led not only to varied criticism of the group and its activities from across the political spectrum but also to a number of conspiracy theories, which have grown especially popular within certain political movements, although the  different factions of theorists often disagree about the exact nature of the group's intentions and use different sources and levels of evidentiary rigor to back up their conjectures. Some on the left, or of less specific political affiliations, accuse the Bilderberg group either of covertly imposing or generally propping up capitalist domination and corporate power, while some on the right have accused the group of imposing or helping to prepare the way for a world government and a global planned economy. The right-wing theorists tend to treat the group as the central directorate or planning arm of the conspiracy or at least attribute considerable importance to its role, whereas most of the left-wing and more loosely-affiliated or apolitical theorists treat it as just one of a set of institutions that help to advance international corporate interests and ideology.\nIn 2005, Davignon discussed accusations of the group striving for a one-world government with the BBC: \"It is unavoidable and it doesn't matter. There will always be people who believe in conspiracies but things happen in a much more incoherent fashion. ... When people say this is a secret government of the world I say that if we were a secret government of the world we should be bloody ashamed of ourselves.\"\nIn a 1994 report, Right Woos Left, published by the Political Research Associates, investigative journalist Chip Berlet argued that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg group date back to as early as 1964 and can be found in Phyllis Schlafly's self-published book A Choice, Not an Echo, which promoted a conspiracy theory in which the Republican Party was secretly controlled by elitist intellectuals dominated by members of the Bilderberg group, whose internationalist policies would pave the way for world communism.\nIn August 2010, former Cuban president Fidel Castro wrote an article for the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma in which he cited Daniel Estulin's 2006 book The Secrets of the Bilderberg Club, which, as quoted by Castro, describes \"sinister cliques and the Bilderberg lobbyists\" manipulating the public \"to install a world government that knows no borders and is not accountable to anyone but its own self.\"\nProponents of Bilderberg conspiracy theories in the United States include such groups and individuals such as the John Birch Society, political activist Phyllis Schlafly, writer Jim Tucker, political activist Lyndon LaRouche, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and politician Jesse Ventura, who made the Bilderberg group a topic of a 2009 episode of his TruTV series Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. Although conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg Group have gained the most widespread credence by far in the United States, some high-profile non-American proponents have raised them as well, including Lithuanian writer Daniel Estulin and British politician Nigel Farage.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBohemian Club\nLe Cercle\nTransnational capitalist class\nTrilateral Commission\nValdai Discussion Club\nWorld Economic Forum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "title": "Sinking of the RMS Lusitania",
        "wikipedia_content": "RMS Lusitania was a British-registered ocean liner that was torpedoed by an Imperial German Navy U-boat during the First World War on 7 May 1915, about 11 nautical miles (20 kilometres) off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland. The attack took place in the declared maritime war-zone around the UK, three months after unrestricted submarine warfare against the ships of the United Kingdom had been announced by Germany following the Allied powers' implementation of a naval blockade against it and the other Central Powers.\nThe passengers had been notified before departing New York of the general danger of voyaging into the area in a British ship, but the attack itself came without warning. From a submerged position 700 m (2,300 ft) to starboard, U-20 commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger launched a single torpedo at the Cunard liner. After the torpedo struck, a second explosion occurred inside the ship, which then sank in only 18 minutes.: 429  The U-20's mission was to torpedo warships and liners in the Lusitania’s area. In the end, there were only 763 survivors (39%) out of the 1,960 passengers, crew and stowaways aboard, and about 128 of the dead were American citizens. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany. It also contributed to the American entry into the War almost two years later, on 6 April 1917; images of the stricken liner were used heavily in US propaganda and military recruiting campaigns.: 497–503 \nThe contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany. At time of her sinking the primarily passenger-carrying vessel had in her hold around 173 tons of war supplies, comprising 4.2 million rounds of rifle ammunition, almost 5,000 shrapnel-filled artillery shell casings and 3,240 brass percussion fuses. Debates on the legitimacy of the way she was sunk have raged back and forth throughout the war and beyond.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhen Lusitania was built, her construction and operating expenses were subsidized by the British government, with the provision that she could be converted to an Armed Merchant Cruiser if need be. At the outbreak of the First World War, the British Admiralty considered her for requisition as an armed merchant cruiser (AMC), and she was put on the official list of AMCs.\nThe Admiralty then cancelled their earlier decision and decided not to use her as an AMC after all; large liners such as Lusitania consumed enormous quantities of coal (910 tons/day, or 37.6 tons/hour) and became a serious drain on the Admiralty's fuel reserves, so express liners were deemed inappropriate for the role when smaller cruisers would do. They were also very distinctive; so smaller liners were used as transports instead. Lusitania remained on reserve in the official AMC list and was listed as an auxiliary cruiser in the 1914 edition of Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, along with Mauretania. All British and German liners capable of at least 18 knots were listed.\nAt the outbreak of hostilities, fears for the safety of Lusitania and other great liners ran high. During the ship's first eastbound crossing after the war started, she was painted in a drab grey colour scheme in an attempt to mask her identity and make her more difficult to detect visually. When it turned out that the German Navy was kept in check by the Royal Navy, and their commerce threat almost entirely evaporated, it very soon seemed that the Atlantic was safe for ships like Lusitania, if the bookings justified the expense of keeping them in service.\nMany of the large liners were laid up over the autumn and winter of 1914–1915, in part due to falling demand for passenger travel across the Atlantic, and in part to protect them from damage due to mines or other dangers. Among the most recognizable of these liners, some were eventually used as troop transports, while others became hospital ships. Lusitania remained in commercial service; although bookings aboard her were by no means strong during that autumn and winter, demand was strong enough to keep her in civilian service. Economizing measures were taken, however. One of these was the shutting down of her No. 4 boiler room to conserve coal and crew costs; this reduced her maximum speed from over 25 to 21 knots (46 to 39 km/h). Even so, she was the fastest first-class passenger liner left in commercial service.\nWith apparent dangers evaporating, the ship's disguised paint scheme was also dropped and she was returned to civilian colours. Her name was picked out in gilt, her funnels were repainted in their usual Cunard livery, and her superstructure was painted white again. One alteration was the addition of a bronze/gold coloured band around the base of the superstructure just above the black paint.\n\n\n=== 1915 ===\n\nThe British established a naval blockade of Germany on the outbreak of war in August 1914, issuing a comprehensive list of contraband that grew to include even foodstuffs, and in early November 1914 Britain declared the North Sea to be a \"military area\", with any ships entering the North Sea doing so at their own risk unless they obeyed specific Royal Navy instructions.\n\nBy early 1915, a new threat to British shipping began to materialise: U-boats (submarines). At first, the Germans used them only to attack naval vessels, and they achieved only occasional—but sometimes spectacular—successes. U-boats then began to attack merchant vessels at times, although almost always in accordance with the old cruiser rules. Desperate to gain an advantage on the Atlantic and define a role for the Navy, and heavily overestimating the effectiveness of the new weapon, the Admiralty under Hugo von Pohl decided to step up its submarine campaign. On 4 February 1915, he declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone: from 18 February, Allied ships in the area could be sunk without warning. This was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare, since efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships. However, the German Imperial Admiralty Staff directed captains secretly to target passenger craft, as it was thought that this would deter other shipping. As Germany started the campaign with only 21 submarines, many of which were not operational, many did not take the threat seriously. The US government warned the Germans that they would face \"strict accountability\" for any American deaths as a result of the campaign.\nThe reaction to the announcement by the Lusitania was characterised by confusion. At sea en route to Liverpool at the time of the announcement, Captain Daniel Dow flew the US flag to dissuade attack, at the urging of his American passengers. This led to a storm of controversy from the American authorities and Germany.\nIn the next voyage, Lusitania was scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on 6 March 1915. The Admiralty issued her specific instructions on how to avoid submarines. Despite a severe shortage of destroyers, Admiral Henry Oliver ordered HMS Louis and Laverock to escort Lusitania, and took the further precaution of sending the Q ship Lyons to patrol Liverpool Bay. One of the destroyers' commanders attempted to discover the whereabouts of Lusitania by telephoning Cunard, who refused to give out any information and referred him to the Admiralty. At sea, the ships contacted Lusitania by radio, but did not have the codes used to communicate with merchant ships, and so communicated in the clear. As doing this would put his ship under substantial risk, Captain Dow refused to give his own position except in code. He gave his position significantly far away from his actual position, and leaving the warships unable to locate him, continued to Liverpool unescorted.: 91–2 : 76–7 \nSome alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation in view of the threat. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the war zone; a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. There was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.\nUnknown to all, the submarine war was about to get more dangerous. On 28 March, during the so-called Thrasher incident, a German submarine stopped a British passenger ship, the Falaba on the surface. Eyewitnesses reported the submarine gave the ship only around 10 minutes to evacuate before torpedoing the vessel, resulting in the first American dead of the war. On 1 April, Admiral Gustav Bachmann, head of the German Admiralty Staff, sent a memo to the Kaiser. This detailed the woefully small number of ships sunk so far, and Bachmann argued this showed that the submarine war can only really be effective if U-boats were completely unrestricted, and so could attack without determining the identity and nationality of ships. With the encouragement of Tirpitz, the Kaiser sent out secret instructions on 2 April to discourage the common tactic of surfacing to attack vessels and emphasize the danger in doing so. This created what historian Arthur Link terms \"an operational twilight zone\" in which mistakes would be more easily made. There was no improvement in the number of ships sunk following this instruction, but 6 out of the 17 vessels sunk in April were neutral. The Germans convinced themselves that Americans were toothless. \"The policy of the American Government is dominated by the one thought of not becoming involved in any complications whatsoever. 'We want to stay out of everything' is the single rule.\" In late April/early May there were German attacks on two additional American vessels, the Cushing and Gulflight, the former (29 April) an air attack that caused no loss of life, and the latter (1 May) a submarine attack on a tanker where three died. President Wilson had not made a formal response to any of these incidents before events overtook him.\nCaptain Dow, apparently suffering from stress from operating his ship in the war zone, left the ship; Cunard later explained that he was \"tired and really ill.\" He was replaced with a new commander, Captain William Thomas Turner, who had commanded Lusitania, Mauretania, and Aquitania in the years before the war. On 17 April 1915, Lusitania left Liverpool on her 201st transatlantic voyage, arriving in New York on 24 April.\n\nIn the middle of April, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, who had long had concerns about the legality of the February submarine campaign, and believing the Americans to be underestimating the dangers, consulted a group of representatives of other German administrative departments, and decided to issue a general warning to the American press. This notice was to appear in 50 American newspapers, including those in New York:\n\nNotice!\nTravellers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies; that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, in accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German Government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters and that travellers sailing in the war zone on the ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.\nImperial German Embassy\nWashington, D.C. 22 April 1915\n\nThe notice was intended to appear on the Saturdays of 24 April, 1 May, and 8 May, but due to technical difficulties did not appear until 30 April, the day before the Lusitania sailed, appearing in some cases adjacent to an advertisement for the return voyage. The juxtaposition was a coincidence, but the warning led to some agitation in the press, annoyance from the American government, and worried the ship's passengers and crew.\n\n\n== Final voyage ==\n\n\n=== Departure ===\n\nWhile many British passenger ships had been called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her regular route between Liverpool and New York City. Captain Turner, known as \"Bowler Bill\" for his favourite shoreside headgear, tried to calm the passengers by explaining that the ship's speed made her safe from attack by submarine. Even at her reduced speed, the ship far exceeded the speed of an U-boat (16 knots on the surface, 9 knots submerged), requiring the ship to pass extremely near a waiting submarine to be attacked.\n\nDeparture out of New York on the return voyage to Liverpool was at noon on 1 May, two hours behind schedule, because of a last-minute transfer of forty-one passengers and crew from the recently requisitioned Cameronia.: 132–133  Shortly after departure three German-speaking men were found on board hiding in a steward's pantry. Detective Inspector William Pierpoint of the Liverpool police, who was travelling in the guise of a first-class passenger, interrogated them before locking them in the cells for further questioning when the ship reached Liverpool.: 156, 445–446  Also among the crew was an Englishman, Neal Leach, who had been working as a tutor in Germany before the war. Leach had been interned but later released by Germany. The German embassy in Washington was notified about Leach's arrival in America, where he met known German agents. Leach and the three German stowaways went down with the ship. They were found with photographic equipment and thus probably had been tasked with spying on the ship. Most probably, Pierpoint, who survived the sinking, would already have been informed about Leach.: 131–132, 445 \nThus, when the Lusitania left Pier 54, she had 1,960 people aboard. In addition to her crew of 693 and 3 stowaways, she carried 1,264 passengers, mostly British nationals as well as a large number of Canadians, along with 159 Americans. 124 of the passengers were children. Her First Class accommodations, for which she was well regarded on the North Atlantic run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce the squeeze into the limited number of two- and four-berth cabins, the situation was rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to be the norm for an eastbound crossing, with only 370 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.\n\n\n=== Submarine activity ===\n\nAs the liner steamed across the ocean, the British Admiralty had been tracking the movements of U-20, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger, through wireless intercepts and radio direction finding. The submarine left Borkum on 30 April, heading north-west across the North Sea. On 2 May, she had reached Peterhead and proceeded around the north of Scotland and Ireland, and then along the western and southern coasts of Ireland, to enter the Irish Sea from the south. Although the submarine's departure, destination, and expected arrival time were known to Room 40 in the Admiralty, the activities of the decoding department were considered so secret that they were unknown even to the normal intelligence division which tracked enemy ships or to the trade division responsible for warning merchant vessels. Only the very highest officers in the Admiralty saw the information and passed on warnings only when they felt it essential.\nOn 27 March, Room 40 had intercepted a message which clearly demonstrated that the Germans had broken the code used to pass messages to British merchant ships. Cruisers protecting merchant ships were warned not to use the code to give directions to shipping because it could just as easily attract enemy submarines as steering ships away from them. However, Queenstown (now Cobh) was not given this warning and continued to give directions in the compromised code, which was not changed until after Lusitania's sinking. At this time, the Royal Navy was significantly involved with operations leading up to the landings at Gallipoli, and the intelligence department had been undertaking a programme of misinformation to convince Germany to expect an attack on her northern coast. As part of this, ordinary cross-channel traffic to the Netherlands was halted from 19 April and false reports were leaked about troop ship movements from ports on Britain's western and southern coasts. This led to a demand from the German army for offensive action against the expected troop movements and consequently, a surge in German submarine activity on the British west coast. The fleet was warned to expect additional submarines, but this warning was not passed on to those sections of the navy dealing with merchant vessels. The return of the battleship Orion from HMNB Devonport to Scotland was delayed until 4 May and she was given orders to stay 100 nautical miles (190 km) from the Irish coast.\nOn 5 May, U-20 stopped a merchant schooner, Earl of Lathom, off the Old Head of Kinsale, examined her papers, then ordered her crew to leave before sinking the schooner with gunfire. On 6 May, U-20 fired a torpedo at Cayo Romano, a British steamer originating from Cuba flying a neutral flag, off Fastnet Rock, narrowly missing by a few feet. At 22:30 on 5 May, the Royal Navy sent an uncoded warning to all ships – \"Submarines active off the south coast of Ireland\" – and at midnight an addition was made to the regular nightly warnings, \"submarine off Fastnet\". On 6 May U-20 sank the 6,000-ton steamer Candidate. It then failed to get off a shot at the 16,000-ton liner SS Arabic (1902), because although she kept a straight course the liner was too fast, but then sank another 6,000-ton British cargo ship flying no flag, Centurion, all in the region of the Coningbeg light ship, around 70 miles east of the eventual attack. According to Room 40 archives, the sinking of Centurion in the early afternoon of the 6th would be the last reported position of the submarine until the attack on the Lusitania.\nThe specific mention of a submarine was dropped from the midnight broadcast on 6–7 May as news of the new sinkings had not yet reached the navy at Queenstown, and it was correctly assumed that there was no longer a submarine at Fastnet. On the morning of 6 May, Lusitania was still 750 nautical miles (1,390 km) west of southern Ireland. However, Captain Turner was given two warning messages that evening. One at 7:52 pm repeated the information that submarines were active off the south coast of Ireland (in the mistaken belief that multiple submarines were in the area). The other, sent out at noon but only received at 8:05 pm gave instructions: \"... Avoid headlands; pass harbours at full speed; steer mid-channel course. Submarines off Fastnet.\" Lusitania was now 370 miles west of Fastnet. Turner would subsequently be accused of disregarding these instructions. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first-class lounge.: 197 \n\nBy 05:00 on 7 May, Lusitania reached a point 120 nautical miles (220 km) west-southwest of Fastnet Rock (off the southern tip of Ireland), where she met the patrolling boarding vessel Partridge. By 06:00, heavy fog had arrived and extra lookouts were posted. Upon entering the war zone, Captain Turner had 22 lifeboats swung out as a precaution so they could be launched more quickly if needed. As the ship came closer to Ireland, Captain Turner ordered depth soundings to be made and at 08:00 for speed to be reduced to 18 knots, then to 15 knots and for the foghorn to be sounded. Some of the passengers were disturbed that the ship appeared to be advertising her presence. By 10:00, the fog began to lift, by noon it had been replaced by bright sunshine over a clear smooth sea and speed increased again to 18 knots.: 200–202 \n\nAt about 11:52 on 7 May, the ship received another warning from the Admiralty, probably as a result of a request by Alfred Booth, who was concerned about Lusitania: \"U-boats active in southern part of Irish Channel. Last heard of twenty miles south of Coningbeg Light Vessel.\" Booth and all of Liverpool had received news of the sinkings, which the Admiralty had known about by at least 3:00 that morning. Turner adjusted his heading northeast, not knowing that this report related to events of the previous day and apparently thinking submarines would be more likely to keep to the open sea,: 184  or that a sinking would be safer in shallower water. At 13:00 another message was received, \"Submarine five miles south of Cape Clear proceeding west when sighted at 10:00 am\". This report was inaccurate as no submarine had been at that location, but gave the impression that at least one submarine had been safely passed. Believing he was in a \"safe zone\", Turner focused on planning a course to Liverpool through what he understood to be dangerous waters further ahead.\nU-20 was low on fuel and had only three torpedoes left. That morning, visibility was poor and Schwieger decided to head for home. He submerged at 11:00 after sighting a fishing boat which he believed might be a British patrol and shortly after was passed while still submerged by a ship at high speed. This was the cruiser Juno (1895) returning to Queenstown, zig-zagging at her fastest sustainable speed of 16 knots having received warning of submarine activity off Queenstown at 07:45. The Admiralty considered these old cruisers highly vulnerable to submarines, and indeed Schwieger attempted to target the ship.: 216 \n\n\n=== Sinking ===\n\nU-20 surfaced again at 12:45 as visibility was now excellent. At 13:20, something was sighted and Schwieger was summoned to the conning tower: at first it appeared to be several ships because of the number of funnels and masts, but this resolved into one large steamer appearing over the horizon. At 13:25, the submarine submerged to periscope depth of 11 metres and set a course to intercept the liner at her maximum submerged speed of 9 knots. When the ships had closed to 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) Lusitania turned away, Schwieger feared he had lost his target, but she turned again, this time onto a near ideal course to bring her into position for an attack. At 14:10, with the target at 700 metres (2,300 ft) range he ordered one gyroscopic torpedo to be fired, set to run at a depth of three metres (10 ft).: 216–217  According to Schwieger, he did not know the identity of the ship before he attacked, only that it was a large passenger ship. In his career, he launched several attacks without identifying his target, including a later attack on RMS Hesperian where he broke orders prohibiting attacking passenger vessels. Schwieger also misjudged the ship's speed to be 20 knots, but unfortunately for the Lusitania, this offset another error he had made in the angle of attack. The torpedo was now on course to strike the ship in around a minute.\nOn board the Lusitania, Leslie Morton, an eighteen-year-old lookout at the bow, had spotted thin lines of foam racing toward the ship. He shouted, \"Torpedoes coming on the starboard side!\" through a megaphone, thinking the bubbles came from two projectiles, not one. Schwieger's log entries attest that he launched only one torpedo. Some doubt the validity of this claim, contending that the German government subsequently altered the published fair copy of Schwieger's log,: 416–419  but accounts from other U-20 crew members corroborate it. The entries were also consistent with intercepted radio reports sent to Germany by U-20 once she had returned to the North Sea, before any possibility of an official cover-up. Upon impact, he describes:  “I saw the torpedo coming, a white streak about two feet below the surface. It struck just below the bridge. There was a muffled explosion, and a cloud of coal dust and steam shot up. Then, almost instantly, there came a second explosion—far greater, more shattering. The ship trembled like a living thing.”\nNext, in Schwieger's own words, recorded in the log of U-20:\n\nTorpedo hits starboard side right behind the bridge. An unusually heavy detonation takes place with a very strong explosive cloud. The explosion of the torpedo must have been followed by a second one [boiler or coal or powder?]... The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly, immersing simultaneously at the bow... the name Lusitania becomes visible in golden letters.\nThough Schwieger states the torpedo hit behind the bridge, and thus in the vicinity of the first funnel, survivor testimony, including that of Captain Turner, gave a number of different locations: some stated it was between the first and second funnels, others between the third and fourth. Most were in approximate agreement, as witnesses reported a plume of water which knocked Lifeboat No. 5 off its davits and a geyser of steel plating, coal smoke, cinders, and debris high above the deck, and crew working in the boilers claimed they were inundated immediately. This would accord with Schwieger's description. \"It sounded like a million-ton hammer hitting a steam boiler a hundred feet high\", one passenger said. A second explosion followed, ringing throughout the ship, and thick grey smoke began to pour out of the funnels and ventilator cowls that led deep into the boiler rooms. U-20's torpedo officer, Raimund Weisbach, viewed the destruction through the vessel's periscope and would recall only that the explosion of the torpedo was unusually severe.\n\nAt 14:12, Captain Turner had Quartermaster Johnston stationed at the ship's wheel to steer \"hard-a-starboard\" towards the Irish coast, which Johnston confirmed, but the ship could not be steadied and rapidly ceased to respond to the wheel. Turner signalled for the engines to be reversed to halt the ship, but although the signal was received in the engine room, nothing could be done. Steam pressure had collapsed from 195 psi before the explosion, to 50 psi and falling afterwards, meaning Lusitania could not be steered or stopped to counteract the list or to beach herself.: 227  Lusitania's wireless operator sent out an immediate SOS, which was acknowledged by a coastal wireless station. Shortly afterward he transmitted the ship's position, 10 nautical miles (19 km) south of the Old Head of Kinsale.: 228  At 14:14, electrical power failed, plunging the cavernous interior of the ship into darkness. Radio signals continued on emergency batteries, but electric lifts failed, trapping crew members in the forward cargo hold who had been preparing luggage to go ashore at Liverpool later that evening; it was these seamen precisely who were to report to muster stations to launch lifeboats in the event of a sinking; bulkhead doors, that were closed as a precaution before the attack, could not be reopened to release trapped men.: 238–240  Few testimonies report passengers trapped in the two central elevators, though one saloon passenger claimed to have seen the lifts stuck between the boat deck and the deck below while passing through the First Class entrance.\nAbout one minute after the electrical power failed, Captain Turner gave the order to abandon ship. Water had flooded the ship's starboard longitudinal compartments, causing a 15-degree list to starboard. Within six minutes of the attack, Lusitania's forecastle had begun to submerge.\nLusitania's severe starboard list complicated the launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedo struck, when she had slowed enough to start putting boats in the water, the lifeboats on the starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered they dragged on the inch-high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage or capsize the boats before they landed in the water.\n\nMany lifeboats overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers into the sea and others were overturned by the ship's motion when they hit the water. It has been claimed that some boats, because of the negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some untrained crewmen would lose their grip on handheld ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, spilling their occupants into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only 6 were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 (5 people on board) and 11 (7 people on board) managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, overloaded with around 150 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 (52 people on board) reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided flotation for some survivors.\nTwo lifeboats on the port side cleared the ship as well. Lifeboat 14 (11 people on board) was lowered and launched safely, but because the boat plug was not in place, it filled with seawater and sank almost immediately after reaching the water. Later, Lifeboat 2 floated away from the ship with new occupants (its previous ones having been spilled into the sea when they upset the boat) after they removed a rope and one of the ship's \"tentacle-like\" funnel stays. They rowed away shortly before the ship sank.\nAccording to Schwieger, he observed panic and disorder on the starboard side of the deck through U-20's periscope, and by 14:25 he dropped the periscope and headed out to sea. Later that day, he attempted to torpedo an American tanker Narragansett (the torpedo missed). Subsequently, the submarine traveled North up the West coast of Ireland, and proceeded to Wilhelmshaven. Schwieger would eventually be killed on 5 September 1917, when his submarine U-88 struck a British mine north of Terschelling and was lost with all hands.\nSurviving passengers on the port side of the deck, however, paint a calmer picture. Many, including author Charles Lauriat, who published his account of the disaster, stated that a few passengers climbed into the early portside lifeboats before being ordered out by Staff Captain James Anderson, who proclaimed, \"This ship will not sink\" and reassured those nearby that the liner had \"touched bottom\" and would stay afloat. In reality, he had ordered the crew to wait and fill Lusitania’s portside ballast tanks with seawater to even the ship's trim so the lifeboats could be lowered safely. As a result, few boats on the port side were launched, none under Anderson's supervision.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nCaptain Turner was on the deck near the bridge clutching the ship's logbook and charts when a wave swept upward towards the bridge and the rest of the ship's forward superstructure, knocking him overboard into the sea. He managed to swim and find a chair floating in the water which he clung to. He survived, having been pulled unconscious from the water after spending three hours there. Lusitania's bow slammed into the bottom about 100 metres (330 ft) below at a shallow angle because of her forward momentum as she sank. Along the way, some boilers exploded and the ship returned briefly to an even keel. Turner's last navigational fix had been only two minutes before the torpedoing, and he was able to remember the ship's speed and bearing at the moment of the sinking. This was accurate enough to locate the wreck after the war. The ship travelled about two nautical miles (4 km) from the time of the torpedoing to her final resting place, leaving a trail of debris and people behind. After her bow sank completely, Lusitania's stern rose out of the water, enough for her propellers to be seen, and went under. As the tips of Lusitania's four, 70-foot-tall funnels dipped beneath the surface, they formed whirlpools which dragged nearby swimmers down with the ship. Her masts and rigging were the last to disappear.\nLusitania sank in only 18 minutes, at a distance of 11.5 nautical miles (21 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale. Despite being relatively close to shore, it took several hours for help to arrive from the Irish coast. By the time help arrived, however, many in the 52 °F (11 °C) water had succumbed to the cold. By the days' end, 767 passengers and crew from Lusitania had been rescued and landed at Queenstown, though 4 died shortly after. The final death toll for the disaster came to a catastrophic number. Of the 1,960 aboard Lusitania at the time of her sinking, 1,197 (61%) had been lost, including 94 children and about 128 Americans (though the official toll at the time gave slightly different numbers). In the days following the disaster, the Cunard line offered local fishermen and sea merchants a cash reward for the bodies floating all throughout the Irish Sea, some floating as far away as the Welsh coast. Only 289 bodies were recovered, 65 of which were never identified. The bodies of many of the victims were buried at either Queenstown, where 148 bodies were interred in the Old Church Cemetery, or the Church of St Multose in Kinsale, but the bodies of the remaining 885 victims were never recovered.\nOne story—an urban legend—states that when Lieutenant Schwieger of U-20 gave the order to fire, his quartermaster, Charles Voegele, would not take part in an attack on women and children, and refused to pass on the order to the torpedo room – a decision for which he was court-martialed and imprisoned at Kiel until the end of the war. This rumour persisted from 1972, when the French daily paper Le Monde published a letter to the editor. However, Voegele was the U-20's electrician at the time of the torpedoing, not the quartermaster. Despite seemingly putting an end to this rumor, Voegele's alleged hesitation was depicted in the torpedoing scene of the 2007 docudrama Sinking of the Lusitania: Terror at Sea.\n\n\n=== Notable passengers ===\n\n\n==== Survived ====\nCrew\nWilliam Thomas Turner, 59.

Most of the survivors (and dead) had been taken to Queenstown instead of Kinsale, which was closer. On 10 May Captain Turner gave evidence as to the events of the sinking where he described that the ship had been struck by one torpedo between the third and fourth funnels. This had been followed immediately by a second explosion. He acknowledged receiving general warnings about submarines, but had not been informed of the sinking of Earl of Lathom. He stated that he had received other instructions from the Admiralty which he had carried out but was not permitted to discuss. The coroner brought in a verdict that the deceased had drowned following an attack on an unarmed non-combatant vessel contrary to international law. Half an hour after the inquest had concluded and its results given to the press, the Crown Solicitor for Cork, Harry Wynne, arrived with instructions to halt it. Captain Turner was not to give evidence and no statements should be made about any instructions given to shipping about avoiding submarines.: 330–332 \n\n\n=== Board of Trade investigation ===\n\nThe formal Board of Trade investigation into the sinking was presided over by Wreck Commissioner Lord Mersey and took place in the Westminster Central Hall from 15 to 18 June 1915 with further sessions at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 1 July and Caxton Hall on 17 July. Lord Mersey had a background in commercial rather than maritime law but had presided over a number of important maritime investigations, including that into the loss of Titanic. He was assisted by four assessors, Admiral Sir Frederick Inglefield, Lieutenant Commander Hearn and two merchant navy captains, D. Davies and J. Spedding. The Attorney General, Sir Edward Carson, represented the Board of Trade, assisted by the Solicitor General, F. E. Smith. Butler Aspinall, who had represented the Board of Trade at the Titanic inquiry, was retained to represent Cunard. A total of 36 witnesses were called, Lord Mersey querying why more of the survivors would not be giving evidence. Most of the sessions were public but two on 15 and 18 June were held in camera when evidence regarding navigation of the ship was presented.\nStatements were collected from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, and that it had been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one.: 363  In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo.: 457  Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clement Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.: 367 \n\nIt was during the closed hearings that the Admiralty tried to lay the blame on Captain Turner, their intended line being that Turner had been negligent. The roots of this view began in the first reports about the sinking from Vice-Admiral Coke commanding the Navy at Queenstown. He reported that \"ship was especially warned that submarines were active on south coast and to keep mid-channel course avoiding headlands also position of submarine off Cape Clear at 10:00 was communicated by W/T to her\". Captain Richard Webb, Director of the Trade Division, began to prepare a dossier of signals sent to Lusitania which Turner may have failed to observe. First Sea Lord Fisher noted on one document submitted by Webb for review: \"As the Cunard company would not have employed an incompetent man its a certainty that Captain Turner is not a fool but a knave. I hope that Turner will be arrested immediately after the enquiry whatever the verdict\". First Lord Winston Churchill noted: \"I consider the Admiralty's case against Turner should be pressed by a skilful counsel and that Captain Webb should attend as a witness, if not employed as an assessor. We will pursue the captain without check\". In the event, both Churchill and Fisher were replaced in their positions before the enquiry because of the failures of the Gallipoli campaign.\nPart of the proceedings turned on the question of proper evasive tactics against submarines. It was put to Captain Turner that he had failed to comply with Admiralty instructions to travel at high speed, maintain a zig-zag course and keep away from shore. Lusitania had slowed to 15 knots at one point because of fog, but had otherwise maintained 18 knots passing Ireland. 18 knots was faster than all but nine other ships in the British merchant fleet could achieve and was comfortably faster than the submarine. At the time, no ship had been torpedoed travelling at more than 15 knots. Although he might have achieved 21 knots and had given orders to raise steam ready to do so, he was also under orders to time his arrival at Liverpool for high tide so that the ship would not have to wait to enter port. Thus, he chose to travel more slowly.\nHowever, Turner could have also accomplished his desired arrival time at high speed by zig-zagging, albeit at a higher cost in fuel. Naval instructions about zig-zagging were read to the captain, who confirmed that he had received them, though later added that they did not appear to be as he recollected. This was unsurprising, since the general regulations quoted had been approved only on 25 April, after Lusitania's last arrival in New York, and started distribution on 13 May, after she sank, though Turner's response indicated that he had received some earlier specific instructions on 16 April. Turner expressed that his interpretation of the advice he did receive was to zig-zag once submarines were sighted, which would be useless in the case of a surprise submerged attack.\n\nAlthough the Admiralty instructed ships to keep well offshore, it was also not clear how far this meant. The Admiralty claimed that Turner had only been 8 nautical miles (15 km) away, while his actual distance when hit was thirteen nautical miles (24 km). Both were still substantially more distant than the 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) distant course ships would have taken during peacetime, which ironically also would have caused Lusitania to miss the submarine. However, Turner had been intent on bringing the ship far closer. Turner stated that he had discussed the matter of what course the ship should take with his two most senior officers, Captain Anderson and Chief Officer Piper, neither of whom survived. The three had agreed that the Admiralty warning of \"submarine activity 20 miles [37 km] south of Coningbeg\" effectively overrode other Admiralty advice to keep to 'mid channel', which was where he believed the submarines to be. He had, therefore, approached the Head of Kinsale to obtain a bearing, intending to bring the ship closer to land and then take a course north of the reported submarine a mere half mile away from shore. It was while steering a straight course to obtain this bearing that the attack came.\n\nAt one point in the proceedings, Smith attempted to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that it was his job to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.\n\nAn additional hearing took place on 1 July, at the insistence of Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded to him like the rattling of machine gun fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room at the rear of the ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and then distorted and leaked to the press so as to discredit him.: 367–369  The rifle cartridges Marichal alluded to were mentioned during the case, with Lord Mersey stating that \"the 5,000 cases of ammunition on board were 50 yards away from where the torpedo struck the ship, there were no other explosives on board\". All had agreed they could not have caused the second explosion.\nIn the end, Captain Turner, the Cunard Company, and the Royal Navy were absolved of any negligence, and all blame was placed on the German government. Lord Mersey found that Turner did deviate from Admiralty instructions which may have saved the ship, but such instructions were suggestions more than orders. Thus, the captain had \"exercised his judgment for the best\" and that the blame for the disaster \"must rest solely with those who plotted and with those who committed the crime\".\nAccording to Simpson, Lord Mersey later told his children: \"The Lusitania case was a damned, dirty business!\" While a public report was presented to Parliament and reported on by the British press, Simpson suggests the existence of a fuller, secret report, which might exist amongst Lord Mersey's private papers after his death, but has since proved untraceable. Bailey and Ryan are of the opinion that Mersey decided to \"whitewash\" Turner, having indicated suspicion of mismanagement from Turner and Cunard in his questioning. Admiral Inglefield had suggested he blame Turner for disobeying Admiralty orders, but Mersey had responded that this may help strengthen Germany's case. When the verdict came, it was met with anger and surprise from Lusitania survivors.\n\n\n=== American court proceedings ===\n\nIn the United States, 67 claims for compensation were lodged against Cunard, which were all heard together in 1918 before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Julius Mayer, presided over the case: he had previously presided over the case brought following the loss of the Titanic, where he had ruled in favour of the shipping company. Mayer was a conservative who was considered a safe pair of hands with matters of national interest, and whose favourite remark to lawyers was to \"come to the point\". The case was to be heard without a jury. The two sides agreed beforehand that no question would be raised regarding whether Lusitania had been armed or carrying troops or ammunition. Thirty-three witnesses who could not travel to the US gave statements in England to Commissioner R. V. Wynne. Evidence produced in open court for the Mersey investigation was considered, but evidence from the British closed sessions was not. The Defence of the Realm Act was invoked so that British witnesses could not give evidence on any subject it covered. Statements had been collected in Queenstown after the sinking by the American Consul, Wesley Frost, but these were not produced.: 413–414 \nCaptain Turner gave evidence in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that up until the time of the sinking he had no reason to think that zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30 minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.\nMany witnesses testified that portholes across the ship had been open at the time of the sinking, and an expert witness confirmed that such a porthole three feet under water would let in four tons of water per minute. Testimony varied on how many torpedoes there had been, and whether the strike occurred between the first and second funnel, or third and fourth. The nature of the official cargo was considered, but experts considered that under no conditions could the cargo have exploded. A record exists that Crewman Jack Roper wrote to Cunard in 1919 requesting expenses for his testimony in accord with the line indicated by Cunard.: 415–416 \nThe decision was rendered on 23 August 1918. Mayer's judgement was that \"the cause of the sinking was the illegal act of the Imperial German Government\", that two torpedoes had been involved, that the captain had acted properly and emergency procedures had been up to the standard then expected. He ruled that further claims for compensation should be addressed to the German government (which eventually paid $2.5 million in 1925).\n\n\n== International reaction ==\n\n\n=== German ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn 8 May Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former German Colonial Secretary and representative of the German Red Cross, made a statement in Cleveland, Ohio, in which he attempted to justify the sinking of Lusitania. Described by the New York Times as \"the Kaiser's official mouthpiece\", Dernburg was in fact acting as a private citizen with no official role in the German Foreign office, but had organised a New York \"Press Bureau\" to spread German propaganda since 1914. Dernburg said that because Lusitania \"carried contraband of war\" and also because she \"was classed as an auxiliary cruiser\" Germany had had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard. Dernburg further said that the warnings given by the German Embassy before her sailing, plus the 18 February note declaring the existence of \"war zones\" relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of the American citizens aboard. He referred to the ammunition and military goods declared on Lusitania's manifest and said that \"vessels of that kind\" could be seized and destroyed under the Hague rules without any respect to a war zone.\nThe following day the German government issued an official communication regarding the sinking in which it said that the Cunard liner Lusitania \"was yesterday torpedoed by a German submarine and sank\", that Lusitania \"was naturally armed with guns, as were recently most of the English mercantile steamers\" and that \"as is well known here, she had large quantities of war material in her cargo\". This would be the official German line for the immediate aftermath.\nThe sinking was severely criticised by and met with disapproval in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, while in the German press, the sinking was deplored by Vorwärts, the daily newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and also by Captain Persius, an outspoken naval critic who wrote for the Berliner Tageblatt. However much of the rest of the press approved of the sinking. One Catholic Centre Party newspaper, the Kölnische Volkszeitung, stated: \"The sinking of the giant English steamship is a success of moral significance which is still greater than material success. With joyful pride we contemplate this latest deed of our Navy. It will not be the last. The English wish to abandon the German people to death by starvation. We are more humane. We simply sank an English ship with passengers who, at their own risk and responsibility, entered the zone of operations.\" The Frankfurter Zeitung wrote: \"For the Germany Navy the sinking of the Lusitania means an extraordinary success. Its destruction demolished the last fable with which the people of England consoled themselves.\"\nIn a 13 July report on conditions in Germany, US Ambassador James W. Gerard reported that due to the highly effective propaganda efforts of the Admiralty press bureau:\n\nAs to Germany’s war methods, they have the full approval of the people; the sinking of the Lusitania was universally approved, and even men like Von Gwinner, head of the German Bank, say they will treat the Mauretania in the same way if she comes out.\nPropaganda medals were made by a number of artists, including Ludwig Gies and in August 1915, the Munich medallist and sculptor Karl Goetz (Medailleur) (1875–1950). The latter privately struck a small run of medals as a limited-circulation satirical attack (fewer than 500 were struck) on the Cunard Line for trying to continue business as usual during wartime. Goetz blamed both the British government and the Cunard Line for allowing Lusitania to sail despite the German embassy's warnings. Popular demand led to many unauthorised copies being made. One side of the popular medal showed Lusitania sinking laden with guns (incorrectly depicted sinking stern first) with the motto \"KEINE BANNWARE!\" (\"NO CONTRABAND!\"), while the reverse showed a skeleton selling Cunard tickets with the motto \"Geschäft Über Alles\" (\"Business Above All\").\nGoetz had put an incorrect date for the sinking on the medal, an error he later blamed on a mistake in a newspaper story about the sinking: instead of 7 May, he had put \"5. Mai\", two days before the actual sinking. Not realising his error, Goetz made copies of the medal and sold them in Munich and also to some numismatic dealers with whom he conducted business. This led to conspiracy theories. Realising his mistake, Goetz issued a corrected medal with the date of \"7. Mai\".\n\n\n=== American ===\n\nOf the 159 US citizens aboard Lusitania, over a hundred lost their lives, and there was massive outrage in America, The Nation calling it \"a deed for which a Hun would blush, a Turk be ashamed, and a Barbary pirate apologize\". Dernburg's comments heightened public indignation, leading to German ambassador Bernstorff to advise him to leave.\nUS President Woodrow Wilson urged restraint. He said at Philadelphia on 10 May 1915:\n\nThere is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right.\nThe phrase \"too proud to fight\" then became mocked by pro-war and pro-Entente groups, as well as factions in Germany who believed there was no real threat of America going to war.\nUS authorities rebutted German claims. While it was true that Lusitania had been fitted with gun mounts as part of government loan requirements during her construction, enabling rapid conversion into an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC), and was listed officially as a \"Royal Naval Reserve Merchant Cruiser\", the guns themselves were never fitted. The great majority of British merchant ships were not armed, and indeed ships that were called up as Auxiliary Cruisers such as the SS Orduña had to at times be fitted with fake weaponry.\n\nThus, Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port of New York, issued an official denial to the German charges, saying that Lusitania had been inspected before her departure and no guns were found, mounted or unmounted. Malone stated that no merchant ship would have been allowed to arm itself in the Port and leave the harbour. Assistant Manager of the Cunard Line, Herman Winter, denied the charge that she carried munitions:She had aboard 4,200 cases of cartridges, but they were cartridges for small arms, packed in separate cases... they certainly do not come under the classification of ammunition. The United States authorities would not permit us to carry ammunition, classified as such by the military authorities, on a passenger liner. For years we have been sending small-arms cartridges abroad on the Lusitania.\nIn addition to the rifle cartridges, Lusitania carried also 1,250 cases of empty shells, and 18 cases of non-explosive fuses, all of which were listed in her manifest. However, US law revolved around the safety cargo posed to passengers and not Germany's strategic needs. Thus Winter's statement was in the context of US testing of small arms ammunition that found them to be \"non-explosive in bulk\", leading to a 1911 ruling that such ammunition can be transported without restriction on passenger ships, unlike explosives \"likely to endanger the health or lives of the passengers or the safety of the vessel.\"\n\n\n=== Wilson, Lansing and Bryan ===\nWhen Germany began its submarine campaign against Britain, Wilson had warned that the US would hold the German government strictly accountable for any violations of American rights. On 1 May, in response to Bernstorff's advert, he had stated that \"no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed\" could be accepted as a legitimate excuse for that act.\n\nDuring the weeks after the sinking, the issue was hotly debated within the administration. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan urged compromise and restraint. The US, he believed, should try to persuade the British to abandon their interdiction of foodstuffs and limit their mine-laying operations at the same time as the Germans were persuaded to curtail their submarine campaign. He also suggested that the US government issue an explicit warning against US citizens travelling on any belligerent ships, and ban contraband from being carried on passenger vessels.\nIn contrast, Counselor Robert Lansing advised Wilson to adhere to the \"strict accountability\" line. He first doubted that information about the cargo of Lusitania had actually been communicated to the submarine making the attack. But to Lansing, who had helped found the American Society of International Law, the issue was about principle, not facts. All that mattered was the German responsibility for the safety of the unresisting crew and passengers of the ship. Once it was confirmed that the ship was not armed and was attacked by surprise, no warning or strategic justification can allow the violation of \"the principles of law and humanity\". The US was already committed to this approach, had never previously warned passengers to not travel on British ships and saying so now would be an abandonment of the government's responsibility to protect its citizens.\nDespite being sympathetic to Bryan's antiwar feelings, Wilson found Lansing's arguments \"unanswerable\". Thus he resolved to insist that the German government must apologise for the sinking, compensate US victims, and promise to avoid any similar occurrence in the future. Wilson made his position clear in three notes to the German government issued on 13 May, 9 June, and 21 July.\n\nThe first note, (citing attacks on 3 other ships: the Falaba, the Cushing, and the Gulflight) affirmed the right of Americans to travel as passengers on merchant ships of any nationality, reaffirmed  the doctrine of strict accountability. As the Germans were claiming that it was impossible to conduct submarine warfare against merchant vessels \"without disregarding those rules of fairness, reason, justice, and humanity which all modern opinion regards as imperative\", \"manifestly, submarines cannot be used against merchantmen\". Bryan discredited himself when he told Austro-Hungarian ambassador Konstantin Dumba that the American protest was only for the benefit of US public opinion and its sharp tone should be disregarded. A defensive German response came on 28 May.\nIn the second note, in a reply to the German response, Wilson flatly rejected the German defenses. The vessel was not armed, the cargo was legal under American law, and all these questions were immaterial as to the core issue – the means of the ship's destruction.\n\nWhatever be the other facts regarding the Lusitania, the principle fact is that a great steamer, primarily and chiefly a conveyance for passengers, and carrying more than a thousand souls who had no part or lot in the conduct of the war, was torpedoed and sunk without so much as a challenge or warning, and that men, women and children were sent to their death in circumstances unparalleled in modern warfare.\nThe fact that more than one hundred American citizens were among those who perished made it the duty of the Government of the United States to speak of these things and once more, with solemn emphasis, to call the attention of the Imperial German Government to the grave responsibility which the Government of the United States conceives that it has incurred in this tragic occurrence, and to the indisputable principle upon which that responsibility rests.\nThe Government of the United States is contending for something much greater than mere rights of property or privileges of commerce. It is contending for nothing less high and sacred than the rights of humanity, which every Government honors itself in respecting and which no Government is justified in resigning on behalf of those under its care and authority.\nOnly her actual resistance to capture or refusal to stop when ordered to do so for the purpose of visit could have afforded the commander of the submarine any justification for so much as putting the lives of those on board the ship in jeopardy. This principle the Government of the United States understands the explicit instructions issued on August 3, 1914, by the Imperial German Admiralty to its commanders at sea to have recognized and embodied, as do the naval codes of all other nations, and upon it every traveler and seaman had a right to depend.\n\nIt is upon this principle of humanity as well as upon the law founded upon this principle that the United States must stand.\nBryan considered the second note too provocative and refused to sign, and so resigned as Secretary of State. He was replaced by Lansing. Lansing later said in his memoirs that due to the tragedy he always had the \"conviction that we [the United States] would ultimately become the ally of Britain\".\nIn the third note, of 21 July, in reply to a more conciliatory German note on 12 July, Wilson (advised by Lansing) made clear that the US considered British transgressions of neutral rights to be more minor in degree, and issued an ultimatum to the effect that the US would regard any subsequent sinkings as \"deliberately unfriendly\". The note however indicated that Wilson would accept submarine warfare if it followed the \"accepted practice of regulated warfare\", observing that much of German submarine attacks had been conducted under the established cruiser rules anyway. Thus, while the American public and leadership were not ready for war, a line in the sand had been drawn as a result of the sinking of Lusitania. Later key crises related to the sinking of the SS Arabic (1902) and the Sussex incident.\n\n\n=== German policy reversal ===\n\nWhile outwardly Germany conducted a propaganda skirmish, internally there had long been a faction opposed to the new submarine war. Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff himself had privately concluded that the campaign was of questionable legality and against Germany's best interests. Contrary to Germany's official defenses, Bernstorff believed that the Lusitania could not have been targeted specifically, and that it was \"obviously sound policy to refrain as far as possible from any attack on passenger ships\". Bernstorff saw his role as preserving diplomatic relations with the US \"under all circumstances\", and frequently acted without instruction from Berlin.\n\nWithin Germany there was a fierce debate between German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, and pro-submarine naval officials like Tirpitz and Gustav Bachmann. Tirpitz, who saw the Americans as no threat, had pushed for the official German line on the munitions issue, focusing on inciting German public opinion at the expense of the relationship with the US. The Chancellor enlisted the help of Army Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn, who advised the Kaiser on the danger a break with the Americans would pose. The Kaiser thus ordered on 6 June that secret directives be sent that rescinded Bachmann's order to deliberately target enemy passenger vessels and stated that deliberate attacks on large ocean liners would cease. The admirals had also counted on \"accidentally\" sinking a few neutral ships to deter the others, but now, if the nationality of a ship is in doubt, attacks should be aborted. Tirpitz and Bachmann offered their resignations, but they were rejected by the Kaiser. To preserve the prestige of the German military, not even Ambassador Bernstorff was told.\n\nNevertheless, passenger ships continued to be attacked. The liner SS Arabic (1902) was sunk on 19 August. The ship was sailing outward from Britain, and so clearly not transporting contraband of any sort, further angering the Americans. With increasing evidence of the ineffectiveness of the U-boat campaign, which was originally promised to force the British to the negotiating table in six weeks, Bethmann Hollweg petitioned the Kaiser to publicly forbid attacks without warning against all passenger ships. He said the Germans should work with the Americans, pledging to limit submarines to cruiser rules if the British adopt the Declaration of London and thus loosen the blockade. There was once again disagreement over this move from the navy's admirals (headed by Alfred von Tirpitz), who had no interest in the Declaration if it would prevent them from using submarines fully. On 27 August, Falkenhayn and anxious messages from Bernstorff persuaded Kaiser Wilhelm II to endorse the Chancellor's solution. Bachmann was forced to resign, Tirpitz lost direct access to the Kaiser, and the end of unrestricted submarine warfare against passenger ships was made public to the Americans on 1 September.\nAs the German government was pondering other orders, on 18 September the new head of the Admiralty Staff, Henning von Holtzendorff, rendered these arrangements moot by giving an order on his own authority: all U-boats operating in the English Channel and off the west coast of the United Kingdom were recalled, and the U-boat war would continue only in the North sea, where it would be conducted under the Prize Law rules. Thus, Pohl's U-boat experiment was called off entirely. This would be the situation until the end of the following February, where a brief intensification of U-boat commerce attacks would lead to the attack on the SS Sussex on 24 March 1916, and the Sussex Pledge to adhere only to cruiser rules.\nAt the end of January 1917 the German Government announced it would now conduct full unrestricted submarine warfare, deliberately breaking its prior promises. Once again, Woodrow Wilson was furious and on 6 April 1917 the United States Congress followed Wilson's request to declare war on Germany. US buildup of participation was at first slow, but during the German spring offensive in March 1918, which at first went well for the Germans with the Allies barely holding the lines, was reversed with the arrival by April 1918 of two million American troops.\n\n\n=== British ===\n\nThe British press highlighted the savagery of the Germans, condemning Schwieger as a war criminal. Thanks to the Defence of the Realm Act, matters relating to the ship's cargo were censored. References to the Lusitania appeared heavily in propaganda, and helped motivate the later Baralong incidents. According to Kurt Hahn, the sinking was a decisive turning point in the collective English attitude towards Germany.\nBritish Ambassador Sir Cecil Spring-Rice was concerned about the tone of the British press and that the US should best be kept out of the war. Writing on May 9, he expressed that \"our main interest is to preserve the US as a base of supplies. I hope language of our press will be very guarded.\"\nAccording to US Ambassador Walter Hines Page, the British did not want US military help, but they felt America \"falls short morally\" in insufficiently condemning German methods and character. America thus should at least break relations with German temporarily. British propaganda was thus also aimed at America, with the sinking concurrent with the Bryce report on German atrocities. One over-enthusiastic propagandist's fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of Lusitania. This story was so effective that James W. Gerard, the US ambassador to Germany, recounted it being told in his memoir of his time in Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without vouching for its validity.\nAnother ploy was the reproduction of the Goetz medal, which was done by department store entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge at the behest of Lord Newton, in charge of Propaganda at the Foreign Office in 1916. The replica medals were produced in an attractive case and were sold for a shilling apiece. On the cases it was stated that the medals had been distributed in Germany \"to commemorate the sinking of Lusitania\" and they came with a propaganda leaflet which denounced the Germans and used the medal's incorrect date (5 May) to incorrectly claim that the sinking of Lusitania was premeditated, rather than just being incident to Germany's larger plan to sink any ship in a combat zone without warning. The head of the Lusitania Souvenir Medal Committee later estimated that 250,000 were sold, proceeds being given to the Red Cross and St Dunstan's Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel. Many popular magazines and newspapers ran photographs of the replica or the original, and it was falsely claimed that it had been awarded to the crew of the U-boat.\n\nThe Bavarian government, alarmed at the strong worldwide reaction to Goetz's work, suppressed further production of the original medal and ordered confiscation in April 1917. After the war Goetz expressed his regret that his work had been the cause of increasing anti-German feelings, but it remains a celebrated propaganda act. After the war, in around 1920, the French medallist René Baudichon created a counterblast to the Goetz medal. The Baudichon medal is in bronze, 54 millimetres (2.1 in) diameter and weighs 79.51 grams (2.805 oz). The obverse shows Liberty as depicted on the Statue of Liberty but holding a raised sword and rising from a stormy sea. Behind her the sun is breaking through clouds and six ships are steaming. Signed R Baudichon. Legend: Ultrix America Juris, 1917 U.S.A 1918 (America avenger of right). The reverse shows a view of the starboard quarter of the Lusitania correctly depicted sinking bow first. In the foreground there is a capsized lifeboat. The upper field shows a child drowning, head, hands and feet above the water; RB monogram. Legend: Lusitania May 7, 1915.\n\n\n== Last survivor ==\n\nThe last survivor was Audrey Warren Lawson-Johnston (née Pearl), who was born in New York City on 15 February 1915. She was the fourth of seven children (the youngest three born after the disaster) born to Major Frederic \"Frank\" Warren Pearl (1869–1952) and Amy Lea (née Duncan; 1880–1964). She was only three months old when she boarded Lusitania in New York with her parents, three siblings, and two nurses – and due to her age had no first hand recollection of the disaster. She and her brother Stuart (age 5) were saved by their British nursemaid Alice Maud Lines, then 18 years old, who jumped off the boat deck and escaped in a lifeboat. Her parents also survived, but her sisters Amy (age 3) and Susan (age 14 months) died. Pearl married Hugh de Beauchamp Lawson-Johnston, second son of George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke, on 18 July 1946. They had three children and lived in Melchbourne, Bedfordshire. Hugh was Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1961. Johnston gifted an inshore lifeboat, Amy Lea, to New Quay Lifeboat Station in 2004 in memory of her mother. Audrey Johnston died on 11 January 2011, at age 95.\n\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nThere is no footage of the sinking.\n\nAnimation pioneer Winsor McCay spent nearly two years animating the disaster for his film The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918). At 12 minutes, it was the longest animated film on record at the time. It was also the earliest-known dramatic animation.\nThe docudrama Sinking of the Lusitania: Terror at Sea (2007) depicts the last voyage of the Lusitania and the political and military decisions that led to the sinking.\nThe National Geographic documentary Dark Secrets of the Lusitania (2012) describes an expedition investigating the wreck made by Greg Bemis and a crew of divers in 2011.\nA camera was recovered from the Lusitania wreck and shows images of the sinking ship\n\n\n=== Software and multimedia ===\n\nLusitania: The Greyhound's Wake is an upcoming first-person virtual museum being developed by HFX Studios. The project includes a virtual walkthrough tour of the Lusitania as well as a real-time sinking simulation, with an emphasis on historical accuracy, working directly with historians and researchers.\n\n\n=== Wreck artefacts ===\n\nThe Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, which was the home port of the Cunard line, has a large exhibit about Lusitania sinking. In 1982 one of the ship's four-bladed propellers was raised from the wreck; it is now on permanent display at the Royal Albert Dock.\nA propeller from the wreck is on display at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, Texas.\nAnother salvaged propeller from the ship was melted down to create golf clubs in the 1980s.\nA lifeboat davit and some other artefacts are displayed at the Lusitania Museum & Old Head Signal Tower on Old Head of Kinsale.\nThe original builder's model of Lusitania, repainted after the sinking to represent RMS Mauretania, is displayed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe events of Agatha Christie's 1922 novel The Secret Adversary are set off by the sinking of Lusitania.\nA majority of Kim Izzo's Seven Days in May (2017) takes place aboard the Lusitania. The historical fiction alternates between a group of people on board, including Alfred Vanderbilt and Charles Frohman, and in a secret room in Whitehall in London, where coded messages are being intercepted.\nThe Glass Ocean (2019), written by Karen White, Lauren Willig and Beatriz Williams, rotates narrators and time periods. One of the storylines takes place aboard the Lusitania. It is a fictional account from a passenger's perspective, and weaves in with storylines told in 2013.\nDavid Butler's novel Lusitania (1982) is a fictionalised account of the sinking and events leading up to it.\nH.P. Lovecraft's first published book was The Crime of Crimes: Lusitania 1915 (published in Wales), a poem on the sinking of the vessel.\nThe sinking was the inspiration for Michael Morpurgo's novel Listen to the Moon (2014).\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe composer Frank Bridge, a pacifist horrified by the First World War, composed Lament (for Catherine, aged 9 \"Lusitania\" 1915), for string orchestra, to commemorate the loss of the ship. It premiered by the New Queen's Hall Orchestra, conducted by Bridge, on 15 September, at the 1915 Proms, as part of a programme of \"Popular Italian music\", the rest of which was conducted by Henry Wood.\nCharles Ives's Orchestral Set No. 2 ends with a movement titled, From Hanover Square North, at the End of a Tragic Day, the Voice of the People Again Arose. In the piece, Ives recalls his experience of waiting for a train in New York City as news reports of the sinking come through. The waiting crowd sing \"In The Sweet By and By\", picking up the tune from a barrel organ. Their voices can be heard at the start of the piece, and the hymn tune itself appears at the end.\nA popular song, \"As the Lusitania Went Down\" (1915) by Arthur J. Lamb and F. Henri Klickmann was published by C. K. Root & Co. of Chicago and New York. It was described by The Music Trade Review on 29 May 1915 as \"One of the most interesting of the songs that have made their appearance in the commemoration of the Lusitania disaster.\"\nThe song \"When the Lusitania Went Down\" (1915) by Charles McCarron and Nat Vincent was published by Leo Feist, in New York. Columbia Records issued a recording sung by baritone Herbert Stuart (otherwise known as Albert Wiederhold) and with orchestra accompaniment, as an 80 rpm disc.\nThe song \"Lusitania\" from American black metal band Minenwerfer, on their second album Nihilistischen.\n\"Lusitania\" from American singer-songwriter Andrew Bird. The song features vocals by Annie Clark of St. Vincent.\nThe song \"Dead Wake\" from post-hardcore band Thrice.\nThe song \"Lusitania\" from post-hardcore band June of 44 from the album Tropics and Meridians.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Cruiser rules and Admiralty instructions ===\nThe \"prize rules\" or \"cruiser rules\", based in customary law and influenced by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the 1909 London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War, governed the seizure of vessels at sea during wartime. Although changes in technology such as radio and the submarine would eventually make parts of them irrelevant, they were generally acknowledged at the start of the war. Merchant ships were to be warned by warships, and their passengers and crew allowed to abandon ship before they were sunk, unless the ship resisted or tried to escape, or was in a convoy protected by warships. Limited armament on a merchant ship, such as one or two guns, did not necessarily affect the ship's immunity to attack without warning, and neither did a cargo of munitions or materiel.\n\nDebates between the German Admiralty and the German government over unrestricted submarine warfare had been ongoing since 1914, with senior naval figures proposing that it would swiftly and easily win the war. In November 1914 the British announced that due to German placement of mines, the entire North Sea was now a \"military area\", and issued orders restricting the passage of neutral shipping into and through the North Sea to special channels where supervision would be possible (the other approaches having been mined). Taking advantage of this and the British Admiralty's order of 31 January 1915 that British merchant ships should fly neutral colours as a ruse de guerre, Admiral Hugo von Pohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet and outgoing Chief of the Admiralty, acted outside of the normal protocols and declared an abandonment of cruiser rules, publishing a warning in the Deutscher Reichsanzeiger (Imperial German Gazette) on 4 February 1915:\n\n(1) The waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the whole of the English Channel, are hereby declared to be a War Zone. From February 18 onwards every enemy merchant vessel encountered in this zone will be destroyed, nor will it always be possible to avert the danger thereby threatened to the crew and passengers.\n(2) Neutral vessels also will run a risk in the War Zone, because in view of the hazards of sea warfare and the British authorization of January 31 of the misuse of neutral flags, it may not always be possible to prevent attacks on enemy ships from harming neutral ships.\nDespite wrangling in the German government to limit the scope of the navy's proposed strategy, privately, directives went further, with Admiral Gustav Bachmann directing submarine captains to attack passenger vessels, so as to obtain a shock effect and deter shipping.\nInternational reaction was negative, with many considering the announcement a bluff. Most considered cruiser rules to be still valid, even beyond the end of the war. Nevertheless, in response, the British Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which directed merchant ships to escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but \"if a submarine comes up suddenly close ahead of you with obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed... [...] she will probably dive, in which case you will have ensured your safety...\" Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine that is \"obviously pursuing with hostile intentions\", even if it had not yet fired. Private individuals offered bounties for submarines sunk. Given the vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-calibre shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in significant danger. The Germans knew of these, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts. Bailey and Ryan in their book The Lusitania Disaster put much emphasis on these orders, pointing out that though the directives were \"definitely designed to save shipping\", attempting to ram or even merely to evade could be argued to make attacking the ship legitimate. In their opinion, this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best legal justification for the Germans' actions, though Berlin never made an \"emphatic\" point of it.\n\nGerhard Ritter notes though that even by 1916, the majority of sinkings were still conducted with warning by U-boat deck guns, for they were far more effective than limited and inaccurate torpedoes. Days before, U-20 herself had sunk Earl of Lathom and Candidate while first allowing the crew to escape in boats. The Lusitania was a much larger and faster ship, with a better chance of evading or ramming, though commercial vessels only successfully sunk a submarine through ramming once during the war (in 1918 the White Star Liner HMT Olympic, sister ship to the Titanic and Britannic, rammed SM U-103 in the English Channel).\nIn his communications with Germany, President Wilson adhered strictly to cruiser rules, claiming that only 'actual resistance' by the ship would in his view make the attack legitimate, and that if a ship cannot be attacked safely and legally, then she should simply not be attacked. In argument with German political leaders during the Arabic crisis, Admiral Bachmann argued that they did not want Britain to adhere to the Declaration of London, as it was more important to be able to continue the submarine attacks and British actions helped justify that.\n\n\n=== The second explosion ===\n\nMany survivors from the Lusitania report that a second explosion took place either immediately or a few seconds afterwards, some suggesting it felt more severe. This explosion has been used to explain the speed of Lusitania's sinking, and has been the subject of debate since the disaster, with the situation of the wreck (lying on top of the site of the torpedo hit) making obtaining definitive answers difficult. At the time, official inquiries attributed it to a second torpedo attack from the U-boat, as was recalled by multiple witnesses. However, testimony and radio communications from U-20 makes clear that only one torpedo was fired towards the Lusitania, Schwieger even commenting in his war diary that firing a second torpedo was impossible due to the crowd of frenzied passengers who dived into the ocean in panic. It is possible that a second torpedo, or even a second submarine was present and was covered up, though this is unlikely.\nA debated theory assigns the blame for the second blast on Lusitania's cargo. This included tons of .303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, shell casings and fuses, all of which were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed. The small arms ammunition were known to be non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. The inquiry at the time of the sinking found that there were no other explosives on board, though there has been a long history (starting from German propagandists) of people claiming otherwise. Patrick O'Sullivan agrees that the shells were empty (to be filled with explosives on arrival) and the fuses non-explosive, using sworn testimony from the manufacturer in a later case and an analysis of the shells' listed weight. He asserts that a consignment of fine aluminium powder, possibly disturbed during the first explosion, may be responsible. In experiments though, the explosion of aluminum powder or guncotton (pyroxylene) (a suggested hidden explosive) did not appear to match the properties observed at the time. The presence of other secret explosives has never been proven. Eyewitness reports, including accounts by the U-boat captain and onlookers who saw a specific lifeboat destroyed, also tend to place the position of the initial torpedo strike far back from the cargo hold.\n\nIn the 1960s, American diver John Light dived repeatedly to the site of the shipwreck in efforts to prove the existence of contraband explosives aboard Lusitania's cargo hold, which had been ignited by the torpedo. In 1993, Dr. Robert Ballard, the famous explorer who discovered Titanic and Bismarck, conducted an in-depth exploration of the wreck of Lusitania. Ballard, believing initially that the explosion was due to contraband, tried to confirm John Light's findings of a large hole on the port side of the wreck. Instead he found no hole, and when he inspected the whole exposed area of the cargo hold he found it \"clearly undamaged\". He thus concluded no cargo explosion took place. During his investigation, Ballard noted a large quantity of coal on the sea bed near the wreck, and after consulting an explosives expert advanced the theory of a coal dust explosion. He believed dust in depleted coal bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the torpedo detonation; the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark, causing the second explosion. Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations,  or that the coal bunker where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates.\nIn 2007, marine forensic investigators considered that an explosion in the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. Though accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape from the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode, Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers. Though this account was a physical impossibility, many others did place the torpedo strike in the general vicinity of the boiler rooms. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines. Witnesses reported explosions many minutes after the attack from the flooded parts of the ship, which suggests at least some of the boilers did explode.\nAnother theory is that in fact only one explosion took place, with the \"first explosion\" merely the physical impact of the torpedo on the hull, though this faces the problem that torpedoes of the time used were fused to explode immediately on impact. In any case, explanations like this and the steam lines theory propose that torpedo damage alone, striking near the boiler rooms, sunk Lusitania quickly without a second substantial explosion, and are strengthened by recent research that found that this blast would be enough to cause, on its own, serious off-centre flooding. The deficiencies of the ship's original watertight bulkhead design would then exacerbate the situation, as did the many portholes which had been left open for ventilation. In 1997, naval architects at JMS argued this point, noting that once the ship lost steam pressure, systems like automatic watertight doors would no longer function, allowing the ship in their simulations to sink as fast as it did without any additional damage. In 2012, explosives researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory agreed, arguing that their experiments and evidence from the wreck showed that the torpedo itself caused the catastrophic sinking, with the second explosion having little impact. Historian J. Kent Layton reviewed 86 survivor accounts in 2016, and believed that these, together with the immediate 15 degree list of the ship, indicate that the torpedo struck in between boiler rooms 1 and 2. This was an especially vulnerable location, allowing immediate flooding from both boiler rooms' bunkers, and led to a secondary explosion from the boilers or steam apparatus within that likely did not cause much additional critical damage. The speed of the sinking was thus due to the poor ability of Lusitania to contain flooding.\n\n\n=== British Government deliberately putting Lusitania at risk ===\n\nThere has long been a theory, expressed by historian and former British naval intelligence officer Patrick Beesly and authors Colin Simpson and Donald E. Schmidt among others, that Lusitania was deliberately placed in danger by the British authorities, so as to entice a U-boat attack and thereby drag the US into the war on the side of Britain. Simpson and later authors point to a letter Winston Churchill wrote to Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, on 12 February shortly after the German announcement, focusing on a line where he states it's \"most important to attract neutral shipping to our shores, in the hope especially of embroiling the United States with Germany.\"\nBeesly concludes: \"unless and until fresh information comes to light, I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy deliberately to put Lusitania at risk in the hope that even an abortive attack on her would bring the United States into the war. Such a conspiracy could not have been put into effect without Winston Churchill's express permission and approval.\"\nAt the post-sinking inquiry, Captain Turner refused to answer certain questions on the grounds of war-time secrecy imperatives. The British government continues to keep secret certain documents relating to the final days of the voyage, including certain of the signals passed between the Admiralty and Lusitania. Some authors also claim that the records that are available are often missing critical pages, and assert a number of other disputed claims:\n\nThe British authorities were aware (thanks to the secret decryption activities of Room 40) that a German submarine was in the path of Lusitania, but decided to not to divert the ship to a safer route.\nThe authorities deliberately and maliciously refused to provide a destroyer escort.\nThe ship was ordered to reduce speed in the war zone to make it an easy target.\nSuch a big ship cannot be expected to sink quickly from a single torpedo strike.\nMost historians conclude that such a conspiracy is unlikely. The flow of Room 40 intelligence to merchant shipping, even if it could have been useful, had always been hampered by the overriding goal of protecting the secrecy of the source. Nevertheless, the ship had been repeatedly warned about the general presence of submarines in the area, and informed about U-20's previous sinkings. Indeed, Turner claimed later in life that he felt overwhelmed by the number of warnings he got, imagining that there were perhaps six submarines waiting for him. Escorts were also limited in availability and Lusitania was faster and less vulnerable than those that were available. There would be very little guarantee of a successful attack even with perfect information, as the slow speed of a submerged submarine would require the ship to pass within a few hundred yards of the attacker and torpedo attacks were unreliable at this time anyway. Churchill was speaking to Runciman in the context of offering insurance to neutral merchant shipping that Germany hoped to deter from trading with Britain. His statements did not apply to a British liner – indeed, his \"embroilment\" was meant to create \"safety\" for Allied ships like the Lusitania. Any secrecy could also be explained in terms of avoiding embarrassment at ineffectual and disorganised British anti-submarine warfare measures.\nThere was also little advantage to the US joining the war at this time, nor was American reaction certain – German submarine captains had, after all, been given deliberate orders to target passenger vessels believing this would produce a useful deterrent effect on shipping, and the anti-interventionalist Secretary of State Bryan reacted to the sinking by advising President Wilson to instead simply prohibit passenger ships from carrying ammunition. In 1916, after the Germans were pressured into restricting their submarine campaign, relations between the US and Germany actually improved even as tonnage of ships sunk grew. Meanwhile, relations with the British became markedly worse, with some even suggesting that America join the war against the Allies.\n\n\n=== War munitions ===\n\nLusitania was officially carrying among her cargo 4200 cases of rifle/machine-gun ammunition, 1,250 cases of empty shrapnel artillery shells, and the artillery fuzes for those shells stored separately. This comprised a total of 173 tons. In September 2008, .303 cartridges were recovered from the wreck by diver Eoin McGarry. Additional declared material could be used for military purposes. The cargo included 50 barrels and 94 cases of aluminium (making 46 tons), an unknown quantity of which was in the powdered form used to produce explosives at Woolwich Arsenal, as well as other metals, leather and rubber.\nOverall, these supplies represented around a third to a half (depending on what is counted) of the declared financial value of the cargo aboard the ship, but a relatively small volume of cargo on the ship. The passenger ship was also not an efficient cargo carrier, as much smaller dedicated vessels could carry far more cargo. For example, the SS Mont-Blanc, involved in the Halifax explosion, could carry almost 3000 tons of materials despite being a tenth the size. It also may be noted that the British War Office considered the majority of US-manufactured ammunition in this period to be of poor quality and so \"suitable for emergency use only\", and in any case incapable of supplying consumption of over 5 million rounds per day. American ammunition contracts were cancelled in 1916.\nSome authors speculate on the presence of undeclared explosive munitions. Author Steven L. Danver alleges that Lusitania was also secretly carrying a large quantity of nitrocellulose (gun cotton). Another theory suggests 90 tons of butter and lard (un-refrigerated due to a lack of space and allegedly destined to a \"Royal Navy Weapons Testing Facility\" in Shoeburyness) may have been something else. Additional speculation centered on a consignment of furs, sent from Dupont de Nemours, a company that also manufactured explosives, though such furs were reported to have washed ashore in Ireland. Other authors have suggested that the shells were in fact live, which would mean that around 5 tonnes of cordite was on board, a notion that contradicts the fact that the declared weight of the shells corresponds to ones empty of explosive fill. No evidence of additional secret explosives has so far been found.\nMany authors have suggested some sort of cover-up from the British or American authorities regarding the presence of the munitions. Yet the presence of the materiel was well known at the time, being made public in newspapers, raised in the official British inquiry, and presented to President Wilson. When Senator Robert M. La Follette suggested in 1917 a conspiracy where Wilson was warned that the ship carried 6 million rounds of ammunition, the New York authorities responded by providing him with the correct number. It is true that due to wartime censorship, issues of war materials were not to be freely discussed in the British press, though Germany's communications with the US were printed in British newspapers. However, official denial of the presence of \"munitions\" or \"special ammunition\" at the time really related to a denial of the possibility that the ship was carrying cargo dangerous to the passengers (hence statements like \"she had on board 4200 cases of cartridges [...] they certainly do not come under the classification of ammunition\"), or a denial that the ship was an armed warship (\"equipped with masked guns, supplied with trained gunners and special ammunition\"). The position taken by the British and Americans was not that there was no war materiel, but rather that what was present aboard the ship did not remove the passengers' right to safety, which is inherently endangered when attacked the way the ship was.\nBailey and Ryan discuss this in detail, noting that it was common knowledge that \"dozens of ships\" left New York with similar or larger cargoes of small arms ammunition and other military supplies. Earlier that year, Turner captained another Cunard liner that transported 15 inch naval artillery, despite public protests from Germany. They conclude that sending secret, illegal explosives in a passenger ship is unlikely given the availability of other dedicated cargo ships. They and other authors also note the contradiction of some authors suggesting that the ship was carrying essential war cargo, and yet simultaneously arguing the British were conspiring to get her sunk. The presence or absence of munitions being carried by Lusitania, while raised by early German propaganda, would not have affected the Germans' intention to target her, or the arguments both in favour and against the legitimacy of her sinking. It was in fact initially concocted as a measure by German Admiral von Tirpitz to \"incite public opinion at home\".\n\n\n=== Other controversies ===\nThe wreck was depth-charged or attacked with Hedgehog mortars. A Dublin-based technical diver, Des Quigley, who dived on the wreck in the 1990s, reported that the wreck is \"like Swiss cheese\" and the seabed around her \"is littered with unexploded hedgehog mines\". Similar observations were made by other explorers, such as the 1993 Ballard expedition. Conspiracy theorists have suggested this was part of a plot to destroy evidence of British deception, such as the presence of undeclared explosives. Instead, historians suggest this was due to NATO anti-submarine warfare exercises in 1948, which used the wreck as a target at a time when its historical value was not considered important. Layton notes that the wreck was sold for a mere £1000, and that despite the bombardment, the state of the wreck was such that expeditions in 1993 and 2011 could verify the intact state of the cargo hold, including \"neatly stacked\" ammunition.\nAnother debated topic is the degree of blame that can be placed on Captain Turner. This was the centre of the wartime inquiries, which raised the issue of whether he had disobeyed Admiralty instructions. While he was exonerated at the time, modern historians disagree as to whether this was appropriate. In addition Turner is blamed for the poor preparedness of the ship, including the poor quality of lifeboat drilling, and allowing many portholes to be open. While most would agree that running into the submarine was ultimately a matter of bad luck, with the more modern understanding that the ship may have sunk from torpedo damage alone, the degree to which Turner may have exacerbated the loss of life gains greater significance.\nIt is also suggested that there may have been some cover-up on the German end. This centers around the typewritten and unsigned nature of Schwieger's logs for that day, which implies a lost version more in line with his style for other logs. One suggestion is that Schwieger's log was edited to \"humanise\" his account, the commander being otherwise not noted for expressing much sympathy for his victims. Preston describes a number of inconsistencies in Schwieger's account, suggesting the diary demonstrated \"institutional afterthoughts\", aimed to demonstrate German conscience and British incompetence. A few survivor accounts also noted that they saw the submarine surfacing as the ship was sinking, some offering the criticism that the sub did not offer aid. While this is an unrealistic demand, it has been suggested that this surfacing did genuinely happen.\n\n\n== Wreck site ==\n\nThe wreck of Lusitania lies on her starboard side at an approximately 30-degree angle in 305 feet (93 metres) of sea water. She is severely collapsed onto her starboard side as a result of the force with which she slammed into the sea floor, and over decades, Lusitania has deteriorated significantly faster than Titanic because of the corrosion in the winter tides. The keel has an \"unusual curvature\", in a boomerang shape, which may be related to a lack of strength from the loss of her superstructure. The beam is reduced with the funnels missing, presumably due to deterioration. The bow is the most prominent portion of the wreck with the stern damaged from the removal of three of the four propellers by Oceaneering International in 1982 for display.\nSome of the prominent features on Lusitania include her still-legible name, some bollards with the ropes still intact, pieces of the ruined promenade deck, some portholes, the prow and the remaining propeller. Recent expeditions to the wreck have revealed that Lusitania is in surprisingly poor condition compared to Titanic, as her hull has already started to collapse.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ships sunk by submarines by death toll\nSS Ancona – Italian passenger ship sunk by U-boat\nSS Sussex – Cross-channel ferry attacked in 1916, triggering crisis\nRMS Hesperian – Another passenger liner sunk by U-20\nSS Athenia (1922) – Passenger ship sunk early in WWII\nSS Tubantia - Dutch passenger ship sunk by U-boat, the largest neutral ship sunk in the war\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMedlock, Chelsea Autumn: Lusitania, Sinking of, in: 1914–1918-online.

        "title": "2012 phenomenon",
        "wikipedia_content": "The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and festivities took place on 21 December 2012 to commemorate the event in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala.\nVarious astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed for this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum; an interaction between Earth and Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy; the Nibiru cataclysm, in which Earth would collide with a mythical planet called Nibiru; or even the heating of Earth's core.\nScholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of cataclysmic events as they arose. Mayan scholars stated that no classic Mayan accounts forecast impending doom, and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture. Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, having been refuted by elementary astronomical observations.\n\n\n== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==\n\nDecember 2012 marked the conclusion of a bʼakʼtun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900 AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a text corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the Spanish conquest of Yucatán.\nUnlike the 260-day tzolkʼin still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a uinal, 18 uinals (360 days) made a tun, 20 tuns made a kʼatun, and 20 kʼatuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a bʼakʼtun. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 bʼakʼtuns, 3 kʼatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.\n\n\n=== Apocalypse ===\n\nThere is a strong tradition of \"world ages\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the Kʼicheʼ Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, the current world is the fourth. The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 bʼakʼtuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's \"zero date\" was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th bʼakʼtun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that \"the completion of a Great Period of 13 bʼakʼtuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya.\" In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that \"there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [bʼakʼtun]. Thus ... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion.\"\n\n\n=== Objections ===\nCoe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th bʼakʼtun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. \"There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012,\" said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. \"The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention.\" In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya \"did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested\". Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, \"We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end\" in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, \"For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle,\" and, \"The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in.\" \"There will be another cycle,\" said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. \"We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this.\" Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said \"The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue—that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset.\"\nSeveral prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th bʼakʼtun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala, said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \"supposes changes in human consciousness\". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman (Procurador de los Derechos Humanos), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.\n\n\n=== Prior associations ===\nThe European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of Christopher Columbus, who was compiling a work called Libro de las profecías during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \"Maia\" on Guanaja, an island off the north coast of Honduras. Influenced by the writings of Bishop Pierre d'Ailly, Columbus believed that his discovery of \"most distant\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the Apocalypse. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the Spanish Conquest as the result of popular astrological predictions in Europe of a second Great Flood for the year 1524.\nIn the 1900s, German scholar Ernst Förstemann interpreted the last page of the Dresden Codex as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th bʼakʼtun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event. His ideas were repeated by archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World ... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, The Ancient Maya, the first edition of which was published in 1946.\n\n\n== Maya references to bʼakʼtun 13 ==\nIt is not certain what significance the classic Maya gave to the 13th bʼakʼtun. Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations. Two items in the Maya classical corpus do mention the end of the 13th bʼakʼtun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.\n\n\n=== Tortuguero ===\nThe Tortuguero site, which lies in southernmost Tabasco, Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to bʼakʼtun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:\n\nVery little is known about the god Bʼolon Yokteʼ. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in British Anthropological Reports, his name is composed of the elements \"nine\", ʼOK-teʼ (the meaning of which is unknown), and \"god\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes. He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.\nBased on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokteʼ Kʼuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site. They note that the association of Bolon Yokteʼ Kʼuh with bʼakʼtun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century. Mayanist scholar Stephen Houston contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.\n\n\n=== La Corona ===\nIn April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 kʼatuns with the future completion of the 13th bʼakʼtun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.\n\n\n=== Dates beyond bʼakʼtun 13 ===\nMaya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th bʼakʼtun. Most of these are in the form of \"distance dates\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, 603 AD Gregorian) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it, arriving at a date of 21 October 4772 AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.\nAnother example is Stela 1 at Coba which marks the date of creation as 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, or nineteen units above the bʼakʼtun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent \"the starting point of a huge odometer of time\", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase. Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 2021×13×360 days, or roughly 2.687×1028 years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the age of the universe as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.\nIn 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in Xultún, Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 bʼakʼtuns.\n\n\n== New Age beliefs ==\nMany assertions about the year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified collection of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from \"Mayanist,\" used to refer to an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of \"balancing the cosmos\" was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, 2012 millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included \"suspicion towards mainstream Western culture\", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but \"to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism\". Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a \"disconnected\" society: \"Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.\"\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1975, the ending of bʼakʼtun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global \"transformation of consciousness\". In Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness, Frank Waters tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011 to astrology and the prophecies of the Hopi, while both José Argüelles (in The Transformative Vision) and Terence McKenna (in The Invisible Landscape) discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day. Some research suggests that both Argüelles and McKenna were heavily influenced in this regard by the Mayanism of American author William S. Burroughs, who first portrayed the end of the Mayan Long Count as an apocalyptic shift of human consciousness in 1960's The Exterminator.\nIn 1983, with the publication of Robert J. Sharer's revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's The Ancient Maya, each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the Harmonic Convergence event, Argüelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology. He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a \"galactic synchronization beam\" that emanated from the center of our galaxy, that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 tuns (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in \"total synchronization\" and \"galactic entrainment\" of individuals \"plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery\" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon. Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.\nIn 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012. In 2006, author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, linking bʼakʼtun 13 to beliefs in crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of hallucinogenic drugs and mediumship. Pinchbeck claims to discern a \"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date ... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic\".\n\n\n=== Galactic alignment ===\nThere is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date. Its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by esoteric, fringe, and New Age literature that placed great significance on astrology, especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of axial precession. Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a \"galactic alignment\".\n\n\n==== Precession ====\nIn the Solar System, the planets and the Sun lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the plane of the ecliptic. From our perspective on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \"precession\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).\nSimilarly, the Sun's December solstice position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.\n\n\n==== Mysticism ====\n\nMystical speculations about the precession of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in Hamlet's Mill (1969) by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape (1975).\nAdherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by Munro Edmonson, alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the Great Rift or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the Xibalba be or \"Black Road\". John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology. Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice. Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind. New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events. Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya shamans about the Galactic Center to their use of psilocybin mushrooms, psychoactive toads, and other psychedelics. Jenkins also associated the Xibalba be with a \"world tree\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.\n\n\n==== Criticism ====\nAstronomers such as David Morrison argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above 11,000 feet (3,400 m), an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.\nThere is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.\n\n\n=== Timewave zero and the I Ching ===\n\n\"Timewave zero\" is a numerological formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of \"novelty\", defined as increase over time in the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity. Terence McKenna claimed that the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience.\nMcKenna expressed \"novelty\" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as \"timewave zero\" or the \"timewave\". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the King Wen sequence of the I Ching, an ancient Chinese book on divination, the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's biological and sociocultural evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012. When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th bʼakʼtun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.\nThe 1975 first edition of The Invisible Landscape referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date of 21 December 2012 throughout.\nNovelty theory has been criticized for \"rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community\", depending \"solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic\", and encompassing \"no suitable indication of truth\", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.\n\n\n== Doomsday theories ==\n\nThe idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of human civilization, became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the Internet, particularly on YouTube. The Discovery Channel was criticized for its \"quasi-documentaries\" about the subject that \"sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment\".\n\n\n=== Other alignments ===\nSome people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the \"galactic alignment\" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as \"45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism\".\nSome believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term \"galactic alignment\" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to the Shiva Hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. When re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25 million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger \"disc tides\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact. This \"alignment\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date. Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.\nA third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, being larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.\n\n\n=== Geomagnetic reversal ===\nAnother idea tied to 2012 involved a geomagnetic reversal (often referred to as a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100 billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.\nMost scientific estimates say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete, and do not start on any particular date. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots. There was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.\nA solar maximum does affect satellite and cellular phone communications. David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as \"Solar Storm Warning\", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.\nOn 23 July 2012, a massive, potentially damaging, solar storm came within nine days of striking Earth.\n\n\n=== Planet X/Nibiru ===\n\nSome believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which had appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.\n\n\n=== Other catastrophes ===\n\nAuthor Graham Hancock, in his book Fingerprints of the Gods, interpreted Coe's remarks in Breaking the Maya Code as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 disaster film 2012.\nOther speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the Web Bot project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. Commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.\nThe 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the photon belt, which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.\nSome media outlets tied the fact that the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a supernova at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon. While Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.\nAnother claim involved alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, first published in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.\n\n\n== Public reaction ==\nThe phenomenon spread widely after coming to public notice, particularly on the Internet, and hundreds of thousands of websites made reference to it. \"Ask an Astrobiologist\", a NASA public outreach website, received over 5,000 questions from the public on the subject from 2007, some asking whether they should kill themselves, their children or their pets. In May 2012, an Ipsos poll of 16,000 adults in 21 countries found that 8 percent had experienced fear or anxiety over the possibility of the world ending in December 2012, while an average of 10 percent agreed with the statement \"the Mayan calendar, which some say 'ends' in 2012, marks the end of the world\", with responses as high as 20 percent in China, 13 percent in Russia, Turkey, Japan and Korea, and 12 percent in the United States. At least one suicide was directly linked to fear of a 2012 apocalypse, with others anecdotally reported. Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, followed 2012-related predictions. A panel of scientists questioned on the topic at a plenary session at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific contended that the Internet played a substantial role in allowing this doomsday date to gain more traction than previous similar panics.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nBeginning in 2000, the small French village of Bugarach, population 189, began receiving visits from \"esoterics\"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, Pic de Bugarach, was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army. \"We've seen a huge rise in visitors\", Delord told The Independent in March 2012. \"Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for UFOs]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal.\" In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors. Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the \"event\". Two raves were foiled, 12 people had to be turned away from the peak, and 5 people were arrested for carrying weapons. Jean-Pierre Delord was criticised by members of the community for failing to take advantage of the media attention and promote the region.\nThe Turkish village of Şirince, near Ephesus, expected to receive over 60,000 visitors on 21 December 2012, as New Age mystics believed its \"positive energy\" would aid in weathering the catastrophe. Only a fraction of that number actually arrived, with a substantial component being police and journalists, and the expected windfall failed to materialise.\nSimilarly, the pyramid-like mountain of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted attention, due to rumors that it would emit a powerful force shield on the day, protecting those in the vicinity. Hotels around the base were full.\nIn Russia, inmates of a women's prison experienced \"a collective mass psychosis\" in the weeks leading up to the supposed doomsday, while residents of a factory town near Moscow reportedly emptied a supermarket of matches, candles, food and other supplies. The Minister of Emergency Situations declared in response that according to \"methods of monitoring what is occurring on the planet Earth\", there would be no apocalypse in December. When asked when the world would end in a press conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, \"In about 4.5 billion years.\"\nIn December 2012, Vatican astronomer Rev. José Funes wrote in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano that apocalyptic theories around 2012 were \"not even worth discussing\".\n\n\n=== Asia and Australia ===\nIn May 2011, 5,000-7,000 Hmong ethnic people in Dien Bien province, Vietnam held a protest on the grounds that the end of the world was coming, and the Hmong people would be evacuated to their own Hmong country by \"supernatural force\". The Vietnamese media and government believe that this is a trick of the Hmong ethnic separatist forces.\nIn China, up to a thousand members of the Christian cult Almighty God were arrested after claiming that the end of bʼakʼtun 13 marked the end of the world, and that it was time to overthrow Communism. Shoppers were reported to be hoarding supplies of candles in anticipation of coming darkness, while online retailer Taobao sold tickets to board Noah's Ark to customers. Bookings for wedding ceremonies on 21 December 2012 were saturated in several cities. On 14 December 2012, a man in Henan province attacked and wounded twenty-three children with a knife. Authorities suspected the man had been \"influenced\" by the prediction of the upcoming apocalypse. Academics in China attributed the widespread belief in the 2012 doomsday in their country to a lack of scientific literacy and a mistrust of the government-controlled media.\nOn 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a hoax speech for the radio station triple J in which she declared \"My dear remaining fellow Australians; the end of the world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you know one thing about me it is this—I will always fight for you to the very end.\" Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as \"immature\" and pondered whether it demeaned her office.\nJasper Tsang, president of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, adjourned the legislature's sitting on 20 December 2012 by announcing that he \"would not permit the world to end\" as the legislature had to meet again in January 2013, to the laughter of MPs.\n\n\n=== Mexico and Central America ===\n\nMesoamerican countries that once formed part of the Maya civilization—Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador—all organized festivities to commemorate the end of bʼakʼtun 13 at the largest Maya sites. On 21 December 2011, the Maya town of Tapachula in Chiapas activated an eight-foot digital clock counting down the days until the end of bʼakʼtun 13. On 21 December 2012, major events took place at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. In El Salvador, the largest event was held at Tazumal, and in Honduras, at Copán. In all of these archaeological sites, Maya rituals were held at dawn led by shamans and Maya priests.\n\nOn the final day of bʼakʼtun 13, residents of Yucatán and other regions formerly dominated by the ancient Maya celebrated what they saw as the dawn of a new, better era. According to official figures from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), about 50,000 people visited Mexican archaeological sites on 21 December 2012. Of those, 10,000 visited Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, 9,900 visited Tulum in Quintana Roo, and 8,000 visited Palenque in Chiapas. An additional 10,000 people visited Teotihuacan near Mexico City, which is not a Maya site. The main ceremony in Chichén Itzá was held at dawn in the plaza of the Temple of Kukulkán, one of the principal symbols of Maya culture. The archaeological site was opened two hours early to receive thousands of tourists, mostly foreigners who came to participate in events scheduled for the end of bʼakʼtun 13.\n\nThe fire ceremony at Tikal was held at dawn in the main plaza of the Temple of the Great Jaguar. The ceremony was led by Guatemalan and foreign priests. The President of Guatemala, Otto Pérez, and of Costa Rica, Laura Chinchilla, participated in the event as special guests. During the ceremony the priests asked for unity, peace and the end of discrimination and racism, with the hope that the start of a new cycle will be a \"new dawn\". About 3,000 people participated in the event.\nMost of these events were organized by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. In 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they were excluded from the activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.\nOsvaldo Gomez, a technical advisor to the Tikal site, complained that many visitors during the celebration had illegally climbed the stairs of the Temple of the Masks, causing \"irreparable\" damage.\n\n\n=== South America ===\nIn Brazil, Décio Colla, the Mayor of the City of São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, mobilized the population to prepare for the end of the world by stocking up on food and supplies. In the city of Corguinho, in the Mato Grosso do Sul, a colony was built for survivors of the expected tragedy. In Alto Paraíso de Goiás, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates.\nIn Bolivia, President Evo Morales participated in Quechua and Aymara rituals, organized with government support, to commemorate the Southern solstice that took place in Isla del Sol, in the southern part of Lake Titicaca. During the event, Morales proclaimed the beginning of \"Pachakuti\", meaning the world's wake up to a culture of life and the beginning of the end to world capitalism, and he proposed to dismantle the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\nOn 21 December 2012, the Uritorco mountain in Córdoba, Argentina was closed, as a mass suicide there had been proposed on Facebook.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, sales of private underground blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements calling attention to the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they had spent most of their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\nThe 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced by several media outlets. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.\nThe TV series The X-Files cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth, and mentioned the Mayan calendar \"stopping\" on this date. The History Channel aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as Decoding the Past (2005–2007), 2012, End of Days (2006), Last Days on Earth (2006), Seven Signs of the Apocalypse (2009), and Nostradamus 2012 (2008). The Discovery Channel also aired 2012 Apocalypse in 2009, suggesting that massive solar storms, magnetic pole reversal, earthquakes, supervolcanoes, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012. In 2012, the National Geographic Channel launched a show called Doomsday Preppers, a documentary series about survivalists preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.\nHundreds of books were published on the topic. The bestselling book of 2009, Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol, featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the Julian date for 21 December 2012.\nIn the Ubisoft game franchise of Assassin's Creed, the protagonist Desmond Miles was also inspired by the phenomenon after he was captured by the modern-day Templar organization of Abstergo to experience the genetic memory called the Animus because of his heritage. After his escape, he rejoins the Assassins Brotherhood to help them stop the Templars from preparing the world to end by using a solar flare. Desmond stormed the Abstergo facility in Rome to rescue his father William Miles as he killed both Daniel Cross and Warren Vidic. While the others left the temple, Desmond believes the humanity has a better chance at fighting her than rebuilding society after the phenomenon approaches, he touched the pedestal, which frees Juno from Minerva and activates a protective shield around the Earth that stops the solar flare, at the cost of his life. After Desmond's death, Abstergo had sent a team to collect samples from his body for their new Sample 17 Project.\nIn cinema, Roland Emmerich's 2009 science fiction disaster film 2012 was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a stealth marketing campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional \"Institute for Human Continuity\" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic. Although the campaign was heavily criticized, the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770 million worldwide. An article in The Daily Telegraph attributed the widespread fear of the phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building \"survival arks\". Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.\nThe phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, \"A Certain Shade of Green\" by Incubus referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 (\"Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?\"). More recent hits include \"Time for Miracles\" (2009) performed by Adam Lambert, \"2012 (It Ain't the End)\" (2010) performed by Jay Sean featuring Nicki Minaj,  \"Till the World Ends\" (2011) performed by Britney Spears and \"2012 (If The World Would End)\" (2012) performed by Mike Candys featuring Evelyn & Patrick Miller. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet hoax related to South Korean singer Psy being one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's \"Gangnam Style\" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end. Indian composer A. R. Rahman, known for Slumdog Millionaire, released his single \"Infinite Love\" to \"instill faith and optimism in people\" prior to the hypothesised doomsday. The artwork for All Time Low's 2012 album Don't Panic satirizes various cataclysmic events associated with the phenomenon.\nA number of brands ran commercials tied to the phenomenon in the days and months leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which a group of friends drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse. On 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.\n\n\n== See also ==\n13 (number)\n2011 end times prediction\nDoomsday cult\nDreamspell\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nTriskaidekaphobia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to 2012 phenomenon at Wikimedia Commons\nNASA video for 22 December 2012 on YouTube\nWhy The World Will Still Be Here After Dec. 21, 2012: A Public Discussion with 3 Scientists at the SETI Institute\nAcademia.edu Archived 31 July 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nDunning, Brian (25 March 2008). \"Skeptoid #93: Apocalypse 2012 – The real science behind the events predicted in 2012\".

        "title": "Great Reset",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Great Reset Initiative is an economic recovery plan drawn up by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was launched in June 2020, and a video featuring the then-Prince of Wales Charles was released to mark its launch. The initiative's stated aim is to facilitate rebuilding from the global COVID-19 crisis in a way that prioritizes sustainable development.\nWEF chief executive officer Klaus Schwab described three core components of the Great Reset: creating conditions for a \"stakeholder economy\"; building in a more \"resilient, equitable, and sustainable\" way, utilising environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics; and \"harnessing the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" In a speech introducing the initiative, International Monetary Fund director Kristalina Georgieva listed three key aspects of a sustainable response to COVID-19: green growth, smarter growth, and fairer growth.\n\"The Great Reset\" was the theme of the 2021 World Economic Forum annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, scheduled for January 2021. Due to disruption from COVID-19, the summit was postponed to May 2021, and again to 2022. The Davos 2022 theme was \"History at a Turning Point\", and the Russian invasion of Ukraine dominated the summit.\nThe Great Reset Initiative, and the World Economic Forum more generally, have been criticised by some commentators for promoting economic deregulation and a greater role in policy for unrepresentative private businesses, particularly large multinational corporations, at the expense of government institutions. Other commentators attacked the scheme for fixating on the concept of education, health and vastly overestimating the ability of a group of decision-makers to bring about global change, or for promoting crony capitalism.\nThe initiative triggered a range of diverse conspiracy theories spread by conservative commentators on social media such as YouTube, Tumblr, MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. Among the unsupported theories were the assertions that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by a secret group in order to seize control of the global economy, that lockdown restrictions were deliberately designed to induce economic meltdown, or that a global elite was attempting to abolish private property while using COVID-19 to enslave humanity with vaccines. Great Reset conspiracy theories increased in intensity when leaders such as U.S. president Joe Biden, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau incorporated ideas of a post-COVID-19 \"reset\" in their speeches.\n\n\n== Key components ==\nBy mid-April 2020, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 recession, the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war and the resulting \"collapse in oil prices\", the former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, described possible fundamental changes in an article in The Economist. Carney said that in a post-COVID world \"stakeholder capitalism\" will be tested as \"companies will be judged by \"what they did during the war\", how they treated their employees, suppliers and customers, by who shared and who hoarded.\" The \"gulf between what markets value and what people value\" will close. \"In a post-COVID world, it is reasonable to expect that more people will want improvements in risk management, in social and medical safety nets, and will want more attention paid to scientific experts. This new hierarchy of values will call for a reset on the way we deal with climate change, which, like the pandemic, is a global phenomenon. No one can \"self-isolate\" from climate change, so we all need to \"act in advance and in solidarity\". In his 2020 BBC Reith Lectures, Carney developed his theme of value hierarchies as related to three crises—credit, COVID and climate.\nAccording to a 15 May 2020 WEF article, COVID-19 offers an opportunity to \"reset and reshape\" the world in a way that is more aligned with the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as climate change, inequality and poverty gained even greater urgency during the pandemic. This includes resetting labour markets, as more people work remotely speeding up the process of the \"future of work\". The reset will advance work already begun to prepare for the transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution by upskilling and reskilling workers. Another post-COVID concern raised by the WEF is food security including the \"risk of disruptions to food supply chains\", and the need for \"global policy coordination\" to prevent \"food protectionism from becoming the post-pandemic new normal\".\nIn her 3 June 2020 keynote address opening the Great Reset forum, a joint initiative of the WEC and then Prince of Wales Charles, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that there has been a \"massive injection of fiscal stimulus to help countries deal with this crisis\" and that it was of \"paramount importance that this growth should lead to a greener, smarter, fairer world in the future\". Georgieva listed three aspects of the Great Reset; green growth, smarter growth and fairer growth. Government investments and government incentives for private investors could \"support low-carbon and climate-resilient growth\" such as \"planting mangroves, land restoration, reforestation or insulating buildings\". With low oil prices, the timing was right to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and introduce carbon pricing to incentivize future investments. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to shape an economic recovery and the future direction of global relations, economies and priorities.\nIn June 2020, Klaus Schwab, who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971 and is currently its CEO, described the three core components of the Great Reset. The first includes creating conditions for a \"stakeholder economy\"; improving policies and agreements on taxes, regulations, fiscal policies and trade to result in \"fairer outcomes\". The second component addresses how the large-scale pandemic spending programs with private investments and pension funds could improve on the old system by building one that is more \"resilient, equitable and sustainable\" over the long term by \"building green urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics\". The third component of a Great Reset agenda is to \"harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\" for the public good. A July 2020 non-fiction by Schwab and economist Thierry Malleret develops the plan in more detail.\nIn one of the Great Reset Dialogues, John Kerry and other members of a WEF dialogue discussed how to rebuild the \"social contract\" in a post-COVID world.\nIn a comment according to Charles III (then Prince of Wales), the economic recovery must put the world on a path to sustainability, which would include carbon pricing. He emphasized that the private sector would be the main drivers of the plan. The market should adapt to the current reality by aiming for fairer results, ensuring that investments are aimed at mutual progress including accelerating ecologically friendly investments, and to start a fourth industrial revolution, creating digital economic and public infrastructure.\nAccording to Schwab, they would not change the economic system, but rather improve it to what he considers to be \"responsible capitalism\". The Brookings Institution described this three-point plan in response to the COVID-19 crisis; response, recovery and reset. For the near term it involves response. In the medium term this involves \"rebuilding economic and social activity in a manner that protects public health, promotes societal healing and preserves the environment\". The reset is for systems over the long term of establishing through our \"collective imagination\" a great reset; a \"new equilibrium among political, economic, social and environmental systems toward common goals\".\n\n\n=== Fourth Industrial Revolution ===\n\nKlaus Schwab used the concept of a \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" in a 2015 article published by Foreign Affairs, and in 2016, the theme of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, was \"Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\". In his 2015 article, Schwab said that the first Industrial Revolution was powered by \"water and steam\" to \"mechanize production\". Through electrical power, the second industrial revolution introduced mass production. Electronics and information technologies automated the production process in the third industrial revolution. In the fourth industrial revolution the lines between \"physical, digital and biological spheres\" have become blurred and this current revolution, which began with the digital revolution in the mid-1990s, is \"characterized by a fusion of technologies\". This fusion of technologies included \"fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing.\"\nJust before the 2016 annual WEF meeting of the Global Future Councils, Ida Auken, a Danish MP who was also a young global leader and a member of the Council on Cities and Urbanization, wrote an article that was uploaded to the official WEF website and later republished by Forbes in which she imagined how technology could improve our lives by 2030 if the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG) were realized through this fusion of technologies. In the scenario presented by Auken, the emergence and application of new digitized technologies to sectors such as communication, energy, transportation, and accommodation would result in greater access and decreased cost (ultimately leading to a complete elimination of cost), eventually leading to the end of \"lifestyle diseases, climate change, the refugee crisis, environmental degradation, completely congested cities, water pollution, air pollution, social unrest and unemployment\" as well as other early 21st century crises. By the scenario's 2030 endpoint, anything that had once been a product was now a freely available service, obviating any need for personal ownership of goods or real estate. The article, originally titled \"Welcome to 2030. I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better\", has been criticized as portraying an unrealistic utopia at the cost of privacy. In response, Auken added an author's note in which she said that the article merely represented a potential future scenario rather than any personal utopia of her own and that it was intended to \"start a discussion about some of the pros and cons of the current technological development\" in a way that she claimed conventional reports could not, while the article itself was renamed to \"Here's how life could change in my city by the year 2030\". Both versions of the article describe the loss of privacy as undesirable.\nWhile the \"interest in Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies\" had \"spiked\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 9% of companies were using machine learning, robotics, touch screens and other advanced technologies. An 21 October 2020 WEF virtual panel discussed how organizations could harness fourth revolution technologies. On 28 January 2021, Davos Agenda virtual panel discussed how artificial intelligence (AI) will \"fundamentally change the world\". 63% of CEOs believe that \"AI will have a larger impact than the Internet.\"\nDuring 2020, the Great Reset Dialogues resulted in multi-year projects, such as the digital transformation programme where cross-industry stakeholders investigate how the 2020 \"dislocative shock\" had increased and \"accelerated digital transformations\". Their report said that, while \"digital ecosystems will represent more than $60 trillion in revenue by 2025\", \"only 9% of executives [in July 2020] say their leaders have the right digital skills\".\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\nPolitical leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have endorsed the idea of \"building back better\", as has former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn an 11 June 2020 meeting with the then Prince of Wales Charles III and Permanent Representatives to the United Nations from the Commonwealth of Nations, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke regarding the Great Reset initiative. Trudeau said that the Commonwealth, of which Canada is a member country, provides a space for \"dialogue and collective action on global issues related to sustainable development\" which includes how to \"build back stronger, more resilient, and greener economies\" in a post-COVID-19 world. This is in line with similar statements made on 28 May 2020, when Trudeau and Andrew Holness, Jamaica's Prime Minister, convened an online meeting of \"world leaders and international organizations\" to consult on a \"global response to the significant economic and human impacts of COVID-19, and advance concrete solutions to the development emergency\".\nIn his August presentation entitled \"The Great Reset\", at the Victoria Forum 2020, the Governor of the Bank of Canada described how COVID-19 is resulting in a \"structural shock with broad impact worldwide\". He said that governments, investors in the corporate and financial sector—including central banks, and individuals households, need to evaluate risks and prepare for transitions. He recommended the use of scenario analysis, as a way of describing possible and plausible outcomes as we are faced with a \"high degree of uncertainty\" in terms of climate change, policy, \"technological development\", and \"evolving consumer and investor preferences\".\nIn a 29 September 2020 six-minute virtual address to the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Trudeau described how \"[b]uilding back better\" included supporting the most vulnerable, for example by ensuring \"equitable access\" to COVID-19 vaccine in developing countries, while also working towards reaching the UN's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\nThe media responded to accusations made by Conservative finance critic MP Pierre Poilievre that Trudeau, who had used the term \"reset\" in his September UN speech, was \"harbouring a very ambitious hidden agenda — not just for Canada but for the world\", by saying that the WEF agenda is published on its website. Erin O'Toole, who has been the Leader of the Opposition as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada since 24 August 2020, wrote in a 21 November tweet, \"It's hard to believe anyone would look at the carnage caused by COVID-19 and see an opportunity\". The message was that \"Conservatives want to bring back economic certainty\" while Liberals want to \"reimagine the economy\", which O'Toole described as \"a massive and risky experiment\". The Post said that Poilievre had launched a petition that gathered 70,000 signatures within three days on 20 November in which he cautioned that the Liberals were secretly planning on \"re-engineer[ing] economies and societies to empower the elites at the expense of the people\" to remodel Canada to Trudeau's alleged \"socialist ideology\". Poilievre used phrases from Trudeau's September speech to imply that Trudeau's statement that COVID-19 had \"provided an opportunity for a reset\" to \"reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and climate change\", was evidence that Trudeau was part of the great reset conspiracy theory, that had been circulating for some time.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nA 23 January 2021 Financial Times article said that policymakers around the world are anticipating President Biden's \"reset on trade, tax and climate\". Then President-elect Joe Biden had announced in November 2020, John Kerry would be appointed as U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and Kerry was confirmed in this position on inauguration day, 20 January 2021. Kerry had participated in one of the Great Reset Dialogues on how to rebuild the \"social contract\" in a post-COVID world. Kerry said that COVID-19 offered a \"big moment\" that opened the possibility for the Great Reset. He said the WEF would play a significant role in refining how to respond to climate change and inequalities that were \"laid bare as a consequence of COVID-19.\" The Heartland Institute's editorial director expressed concerns that President Joe Biden, elected in November 2020, would \"bring the Great Reset to the United States\" and that \"the country [would] never be the same.\"\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn December 2021, the Dutch government published its past correspondence with representatives of the World Economic Forum. The documents, which among others called for the Netherlands to take the lead in implementing the Great Reset, were officially made available by the Dutch government.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn January 2019, at a World Economic Forum \"Safeguarding Our Planet\" panel discussion alongside world leaders and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern discussed her government's \"Wellbeing Budget\" and planned environmental changes. These initiatives have been linked to the World Economic Forum Great Reset in related news articles. In April 2020, the New Zealand Finance Minister Grant Robertson discussed a wellbeing focused post COVID \"Recovery Budget\" and an opportunity for an economical reset. Other initiatives promoted by the pair include an Artificial Intelligence drive in New Zealand related to the WEF \"Globalization 4.0\" initiatives to shape a global architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\n\n== Commentary ==\nNaomi Klein, in a December 2020 article in The Intercept, described the WEF idea as a \"Great Reset Conspiracy Smoothie.\" She said that it was simply a \"coronavirus-themed rebranding\" of things that the WEF was already doing and that it was an attempt by the rich to make themselves look good. Klein wrote that Schwab had given each meeting at Davos a theme since 2003. \"The Great Reset is merely the latest edition of this gilded tradition, barely distinguishable from earlier Davos Big Ideas.\"\nIn his review of the 2020 book co-authored by Schwab and Malleret—and the Great Reset agenda in general—Ben Sixsmith, a contributor to The Spectator, said that the Great Reset was a set of \"bad ideas...adopted internationally by some of the richest and most powerful people in the world\". Sixsmith described sections of the book as \"earnest\", glum, dutiful and bland. Ending with \"The Great Reset might be all the more terrifying for not being a sinister plot.\"\nSimilarly, in his review in the Journal of Value Inquiry of COVID-19: The Great Reset, ethicist Steven Umbrello makes parallel critiques of the agenda. He says that the agenda amounts to nothing other than \"a substantial (if not complete) socio-political-economic overhaul\" and that such a proposal is a \"false dilemma\" and that \"Schwab and Malleret whitewash a seemingly optimistic future post-Great Reset with buzz words like equity and sustainability even as they functionally jeopardize those admirable goals\".\n\n\n== 2021 WEF summit ==\n\"The Great Reset\" was scheduled to be the theme of 2021 World Economic Forum summit in Davos, but this was postponed repeatedly to 2022. The 2022 Davos summit theme was \"History at a Turning Point\", and it was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAccording to the Transnational Institute (TNI), the WEF is planning to replace a recognised democratic model with a model where a self-selected group of \"stakeholders\" make decisions on behalf of the people. The think tank summarises that we are increasingly entering a world where gatherings such as Davos are \"a silent global coup d'état\" to capture governance.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\n\nThe term \"Great Reset\", also known as the \"Liberal World Order\" or \"Global Liberal Order\", can also refer to a conspiracy theory called by the same name. \n\nSchwab wrote the preface to a 2010 report of the World Economic Forum's  \"Global Redesign Initiative\", which postulates that a globalized world is best managed by stronger multinational institutions.\nIn 2019, WEF conducted a simulated Global pandemic called \"Event 201\" where world leaders discussed what actions would be taken if such a situation were to occur. Such theories include claims that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by a secret group in order to seize control of the global economy, that lockdown restrictions were deliberately designed to induce economic meltdown, or that a global elite was attempting to abolish private property while using COVID-19 to enslave humanity with vaccines.\nAccording to a 22 November 2020 article as part of BBC's \"Reality Check\" series debunking the theory, those spreading the Great Reset conspiracy theory claim, without evidence, that a \"group of world leaders orchestrated the pandemic to take control of the global economy\".\nA November 2020 article in The Daily Beast said that even before Biden became president, his \"incoming White House already ha[d] its first conspiracy theory to deal with\"—the Great Reset conspiracy theory. Mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times, the BBC, and The Guardian traced the spread of the latest conspiracy theory on the Great Reset, which had integrated anti-lockdown conspiracies, to internet personalities and groups, including Candace Owens, Glenn Beck, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, and Paul Joseph Watson, the UK-based editor of Alex Jones' website Infowars, where he advanced the New World Order conspiracy theory. Ben Sixsmith wrote that the conspiracy theory had been spread by \"fringes of Right-Wing Twitter\", as well as by Australia's One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson (a \"socialist left Marxist view of the world\") and UK conservative writer James Delingpole (a \"global communist takeover plan\"). However, Sixsmith observed the WEF's partners include such capitalist enterprises as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, IKEA, Lockheed Martin, Ericsson and Deloitte.\nMany detractors commonly cite Ida Auken's article on a potential 2030, as well as a 2016 WEF video in which the article was presented alongside other predictions for 2030 and summarized as \"You'll own nothing. And you'll be happy. Whatever you want you'll rent and it'll be delivered by drone\", as evidence of the Great Reset having malicious intent.\nAn October 2020 article by Snopes traced the origins of a chain email posted on conspiracy forums from a member of a non-existent committee within the Liberal Party of Canada that leaked Canada's secret \"COVID Global Reset Plan\" to the QAnon-dedicated \"Q Research\" board on 8chan.\nBy 17 November 2020, a short video of Trudeau's speech in which he described key points of the concept of an economic \"reset\" had gone viral, as it reignited fervor over the Great Reset conspiracy theory that had taken on a new life with the launching of the forum in May. By November 2020,  Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada lamented on his webpage on 17 November that he was the only Canadian politician along with Pierre Poilievre and Colin Carrie, an MP, speaking up against the globalist threat with Trudeau as the \"world's most prominent defender\" of this Great Reset. Other critics included Canadian conservative political commentators such as Ezra Levant and Alberta's Premier at that time Jason Kenney. They claimed that Trudeau's rhetoric resembled that of the Great Reset conspiracy. Conservative Spencer Fernando stated that, \"We want our lives to get back to normal... Instead they offer only more fear, more control, more centralization, and a reshaping of our lives and our economy without even asking us.\" When Poilievre circulated a petition to \"Stop the Reset\", Le Devoir headlined an article saying that the Conservative Party was embracing conspiracy theories. The Toronto Star editorial board criticized Poilievre for \"giving oxygen\" to the conspiracy theory, with some suggesting his post was related to a possible federal election.\nA May 2022 article in The Globe and Mail said that \"WEF conspiracy theory\" was being spread to \"Canada's main streets\" and was brought up during the leadership race of the Conservative Party of Canada. When Schwab \"brags\" about Canadian politicians' connections to the WEF, this feeds into \"theories of cabals\". In 2021, when Schwab said that \"half of Canada's cabinet were Young Global Leaders\" —including Calgary Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner—conspiracy theorists interpreted that to mean that Canadian cabinet ministers are \"minions\" controlled by Schwab. The article called on politicians in Canada who had been \"flirting\" with the Great Reset conspiracy theories through Twitter—Conservative leadership candidates Poilievre and Leslyn Lewis quell the distrust by admitting that \"there is no such cabal\". In September 2022, CBC News tracked the spread of related disinformation and conspiracy theories in Canada.\nOn 13 December 2020, Australian advertising executive Rowan Dean promoted the conspiracy theory on Sky News Australia, claiming that \"This Great Reset is as serious and dangerous a threat to our prosperity – to your prosperity and your freedom – as we have faced in decades\".\nThe conspiracy theory has also been disseminated by Russian propaganda outlets. According to Oliver Kamm, in a 2020 article for the CapX website: \"The propaganda apparatus of the Putin regime has for many months published wild allegations from obscure bloggers that the Great Reset is code for oligarchs to amass wealth and control populations.\" In 2021, the British anti-disinformation organization Logically reported that the website The Exposé has promoted Great Reset conspiracy theories framed as breaking news since its establishment in November 2020.\nGreat Reset conspiracy theories were a theme in the 2022 anti-vaccine film Died Suddenly which appeared on the Stew Peters Network channel on the Rumble website.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKlaus Schwab and Thierry Mallaret wrote a series of books about the topic which were published by WEF's imprint:\n\n\n== See also ==\nDivine Reset (Divine Backdraft)\nGreat Awakening\nGreat Replacement\nGreat Resignation\nMarshall Plan\nReverse Course\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorld Economic Forum (2020). \"Podcasts\" (collection including \"The Great Reset\").\nWorld Economic Forum (2020). \"The Great Reset\" (official initiative website).",

        "title": "Gang stalking",
        "wikipedia_content": "Gang stalking or group-stalking is a set of persecutory beliefs in which those affected believe they are being followed, stalked, and harassed by a large number of people. The term is associated with the virtual community formed by people who consider themselves \"targeted individuals\" (\"T.I.\"), claiming their lives are disrupted from being stalked by organized groups intent on causing them harm.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe concept of stalking arose in the 1980s following increased legal equity for women and prosecution of domestic violence. Generally, stalking has a single perpetrator, who may sometimes recruit others to act vicariously on their behalf, usually unwittingly. Beginning in the early 2000s, the term gang stalking became popularized to describe a different experience of repeated harassment which instead comes from multiple people who organize around a shared purpose, with no one person solely responsible.\n\n\n== Online communities ==\nA 2016 article in The New York Times estimated that more than 10,000 people were participating in online communities \"organized around the conviction that its members are victims of a sprawling conspiracy to harass thousands of everyday Americans with mind-control weapons and armies of so-called gang stalkers\". The article identified a 2015 paper by Sheridan and James entitled \"Complaints of group stalking ('gang stalking'): an exploratory study of their nature and impact on complainants\" as the only scientific study of the topic at the time.\nHundreds of these communities exist online. News reports have described how groups of Internet users have cooperated to exchange detailed conspiracy theories involving gang stalking. Kershaw & Weinberger say, \"Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking\" are \"an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking\" and represent \"a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment.\" A 2020 study established a framework to classify and examine the phenomenon of individuals with the subjective experience of being gang stalked. The study confirmed the subsequent \"serious\" sequelae of their experience and recommended further research.\n\n\n== Persecutory delusion ==\nThose who believe they are victims report that they believe the motivation for the gang stalking is to disrupt every part of their lives. The activities involved are described as including electronic harassment, the use of \"psychotronic weapons\", directed-energy weapons, cyberstalking, hypnotic suggestion transmitted through remotely-accessed electronic devices, and other alleged mind control techniques. These have been reported by external observers as being examples of belief systems as opposed to reports of objective phenomena. Among the community of targeted individuals, gang stalking is described as a shared experience where the gang stalkers all coordinate to harass individuals, and the individuals share their victim experiences with each other.\nA study from Australia and the United Kingdom by Lorraine Sheridan and David James compared 128 self-defined victims of gang stalking with a randomly selected group of 128 self-declared victims of stalking by an individual. All 128 \"victims\" of gang stalking were judged to be delusional, compared with only 5 victims of individual stalking. There were highly significant differences between the two samples on depressive symptoms, post-traumatic symptomatology and adverse impact on social and occupational function, with the self-declared victims of gang stalking being more severely affected. The authors concluded that \"group stalking appears to be delusional in basis, but complainants suffer marked psychological and practical sequelae. This is important in the assessment of risk in stalking cases, early referral to psychiatric services and allocation of police resources.\"\nWhile a great majority of those who claim to be targeted individuals do not pose danger to others, one report found that some have acted out with violence, sometimes extreme. In 2022, a reported believer in gang stalking was accused of killing four people in Ohio; he uploaded a video before the shooting in which he said that he wanted to \"help other targeted individuals\", and that he will conduct \"the first counterattack against mind control in history\". A manifesto was found on his computer, in which he wrote that his neighbors were mind-controlling terrorists.\n\n\n== Notable claimants ==\n\nJames Tilly Matthews (1770–1815), English businessman\nFrancis E.

        "title": "Turbo cancer",
        "wikipedia_content": "Turbo cancer is an anti-vaccination conspiracy theory alleging that people vaccinated against COVID-19, especially with mRNA vaccines, are suffering from a high incidence of fast-developing cancers. Although the idea has been spread by a number of vaccine opponents, including several health professionals, turbo cancer is not supported by cancer research, and there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes or worsens cancer.\n\n\n== Claims ==\nOpponents of COVID-19 vaccines such as Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo have claimed that trace amounts of contaminant DNA present alongside the vaccine's mRNA could integrate in the patient's genome, activating oncogenes responsible for cancer. In response, Céline Gounder pointed out that trace DNA exists in virtually every product originating from cell cultures, and that DNA vaccines are not known to cause cancer despite containing much higher amounts of DNA. According to the US National Cancer Institute, \"[t]here is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines do not change your DNA\".\n\n\n== Examples of claims ==\nA paper by antivaccine activists Stephanie Seneff, Peter McCullough and others claimed suppression of type 1 interferon could result in immune suppression that could promote cancer proliferation. The study suggested hypothetical disease mechanisms linking mRNA vaccines to various pathologies through immune suppression. It used only anecdotal reports from VAERS as evidence, and was described by Jeffrey Morris as \"shifting the burden of proof\" by asking public health institutions to either prove the impossibility of these mechanisms or accept them.\nSimilarly, a Frontiers in Oncology paper discussing a laboratory mouse dying of lymphoma after being injected with the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was claimed to prove the existence of turbo cancer. However, the study in question did not claim any causality between the two events. Notably, the type of mouse used in the study had a higher predisposition to sarcomas and lymphomas, with that specific individual having shown signs of preexisting cancer such as weight loss before the vaccine injection. The setup of the study was also criticized, as it differed from human vaccinations in the method of injection (intravenous rather than intramuscular) and dose in proportion to body weight (480 to 600 times higher). The authors later added that their findings were \"largely misinterpreted\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Priory of Sion",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Prieuré de Sion (French pronunciation: [pʁijœʁe də sjɔ̃]), translated as Priory of Sion, was a fraternal organisation founded in France and dissolved in 1956 by Pierre Plantard in his failed attempt to create a prestigious neo-chivalric order. In the 1960s, Plantard began claiming that his self-styled order was the latest front for a secret society founded by crusading knight Godfrey of Bouillon, on Mount Zion in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099, under the guise of the historical monastic order of the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion. As a framework for his grandiose assertion of being both the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus and a Merovingian pretender, Plantard further claimed the Priory of Sion was engaged in a centuries-long benevolent conspiracy to install a secret bloodline of the Merovingian dynasty on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. To Plantard's surprise, all of his claims were fused with the notion of a Jesus bloodline and popularised by the authors of the 1982 speculative nonfiction book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, whose conclusions would later be borrowed by Dan Brown for his 2003 mystery thriller novel The Da Vinci Code.\nAfter attracting varying degrees of public attention from the late 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical history of the Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium — an elaborate hoax in the form of an esoteric puzzle — created by Plantard as part of his unsuccessful stratagem to become a respected, influential and wealthy player in French esotericist and monarchist circles. Pieces of evidence presented in support of the historical existence and activities of the Priory of Sion before 1956, such as the so-called Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau, were discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. However, Pierre Plantard himself disowned Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau when he described it as being the work of Philippe Toscan du Plantier who had allegedly been arrested for taking LSD, in another attempt to form another version of the Priory of Sion from 1989, also reviving the organ “Vaincre”, that lasted for four issues.\nDespite the \"Priory of Sion mysteries\" having been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as France's greatest 20th-century literary hoax, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion was a millennium-old cabal concealing a religiously subversive secret. A few independent researchers outside of academia claim, based on alleged insider information, that the Priory of Sion continues to operate as a conspiratorial secret society to this day. Some skeptics express concern that the proliferation and popularity of pseudohistorical books, websites and films inspired by the Priory of Sion hoax contribute to the problem of unfounded conspiracy theories becoming mainstream; while others are troubled by how these works romanticize the reactionary ideologies of the far right.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe fraternal organisation was founded in the town of Annemasse, Haute-Savoie, in eastern France in 1956. The 1901 French law of Associations required that the Priory of Sion be registered with the government; although the statutes and the registration documents are dated 7 May 1956, the registration took place at the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois on 25 June 1956 and recorded in the Journal Officiel de la République Française on 20 July 1956. The headquarters of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were based in the apartment of Plantard, in a social housing block known as Sous-Cassan newly constructed in 1956. \nThe founders and signatories inscribed with their real names and aliases were Pierre Plantard, also known as \"Chyren\", and André Bonhomme, also known as \"Stanis Bellas\". Bonhomme was the President while Plantard was the Secretary General.  The registration documents also included the names of Jean Deleaval as the Vice-President and Armand Defago as the Treasurer. The choice of the name \"Sion\" was based on a popular local feature, a hill south of Annemasse in France, known as Mont Sion, where the founders intended to establish a spiritual retreat center. The accompanying title to the name was \"Chevalerie d'Institutions et Règles Catholiques d'Union Indépendante et Traditionaliste\": this subtitle forms the acronym CIRCUIT and translates in English as \"Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of Independent and Traditionalist Union\". The statutes of the Priory of Sion indicate its purpose was to allow and encourage members to engage in studies and mutual aid. The articles of the association expressed the goal of creating a Traditionalist Catholic chivalric order.\nArticle 7 of the statutes of the Priory of Sion stated that its members were expected \"to carry out good deeds, to help the Roman Catholic Church, teach the truth, defend the weak and the oppressed\". Towards the end of 1956 the association had planned to forge partnerships with the local Catholic Church of the area which would have involved a school bus service run by both the Priory of Sion and the church of Saint-Joseph in Annemasse. Plantard is described as the President of the Tenants' Association of Annemasse in the issues of Circuit. The bulk of the activities of the Priory of Sion bore no resemblance to the objectives as outlined in its statutes: Circuit, the official journal of the Priory of Sion, was indicated as a news bulletin of an \"organisation for the defence of the rights and the freedom of affordable housing\" rather than for the promotion of chivalry-inspired charitable work. The first issue of the journal is dated 27 May 1956, and, in total, twelve issues appeared. Some of the articles took a political position in the local council elections. Others criticised and even attacked real-estate developers of Annemasse.\nAccording to a letter written by Léon Guersillon the Mayor of Annemasse in 1956, contained in the folder holding the 1956 Statutes of the Priory of Sion in the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, Plantard was given a six-month sentence in 1953 for fraud. The formally registered association was dissolved some time after October 1956 but intermittently revived for different reasons by Plantard between 1961 and 1993, though in name and on paper only. The Priory of Sion is considered dormant by the subprefecture because it has indicated no activities since 1956. According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity. André Bonhomme played no part in the association after 1956. He officially resigned in 1973 when he heard that Plantard was linking his name with the association. In light of Plantard's death in 2000, there is no one who is currently alive who has official permission to use the name.\n\n\n== Myth ==\n\n\n=== Plantard's plot ===\nPlantard set out to have the Priory of Sion perceived as a prestigious esoteric Christian chivalric order, whose members would be people of influence in the fields of finance, politics and philosophy, devoted to installing the \"Great Monarch\", prophesied by Nostradamus, on the throne of France. Plantard's choice of the pseudonym \"Chyren\" was a reference to \"Chyren Selin\", Nostradamus's anagram for the name for this eschatological figure.\nBetween 1961 and 1984, Plantard contrived a mythical pedigree for the Priory of Sion claiming that it was the offshoot of a real Catholic religious order housed in the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1099 and later absorbed by the Jesuits in 1617. The mistake is often made that this Abbey of Sion was a Priory of Sion, but there is a difference between an abbey and a priory. Calling his original 1956 group \"Priory of Sion\" presumably gave Plantard the later idea to claim that his organisation had been historically founded by crusading knight Godfrey of Bouillon on Mount Zion near Jerusalem during the Middle Ages.\n\nFurthermore, Plantard was inspired by a 1960 magazine Les Cahiers de l'Histoire to center his personal genealogical claims, as found in the \"Priory of Sion documents\", on the Merovingian king Dagobert II, who had been assassinated in the 7th century. He also adopted \"Et in Arcadia ego...\", a slightly altered version of a Latin phrase that most famously appears as the title of two paintings by Nicolas Poussin, as the motto of both his family and the Priory of Sion, because the tomb which appears in these paintings resembled one in the Les Pontils area near Rennes-le-Château. This tomb would become a symbol for his dynastic claims as the last legacy of the Merovingians on the territory of Razès, left to remind the select few who have been initiated into these mysteries that the \"lost king\", Dagobert II, would figuratively come back in the form of a hereditary pretender.\nTo lend credibility to the apparently fabricated lineage and pedigree, Plantard and his friend, Philippe de Chérisey, needed to create \"independent evidence\". So during the 1960s, they created and deposited a series of false documents, the most famous of which was entitled Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau (\"Secret Files of Henri Lobineau\"), at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. During the same decade, Plantard commissioned de Chérisey to forge two medieval parchments. These parchments contained encrypted messages that referred to the Priory of Sion. \nThey adapted, and used to their advantage, the earlier false claims put forward by Noël Corbu that a Catholic priest named Bérenger Saunière had supposedly discovered ancient parchments inside a pillar while renovating his church in Rennes-le-Château in 1891. Inspired by the popularity of media reports and books in France about the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in the West Bank, they hoped this same theme would attract attention to their parchments. Their version of the parchments was intended to prove Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion being a medieval secret society that was the source of the \"underground stream\" of esotericism in Europe.\nPlantard then enlisted the aid of author Gérard de Sède to write a book based on his unpublished manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Saunière had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château (\"The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château\"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château (\"The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château\") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White.\nThe other text was copied from the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to make a case that these documents were centuries old. In 1969, English scriptwriter, producer and researcher Henry Lincoln became intrigued after reading Le Trésor Maudit. He discovered one of the encrypted messages, which read \"À Dagobert II Roi et à Sion est ce trésor, et il est là mort\" (\"To Dagobert II, King, and to Sion belongs this treasure and he is there dead\"). This was possibly an allusion to the tomb and shrine of Sigebert IV, a real or mythical son of Dagobert II which would not only prove that the Merovingian dynasty did not end with the death of the king, but that the Priory of Sion has been entrusted with the duty to protect his relics like a treasure.\nLincoln expanded on the conspiracy theories, writing his own books on the subject, and inspiring and presenting three BBC Two Chronicle documentaries between 1972 and 1979 about the alleged mysteries of the Rennes-le-Château area. In response to a tip from Gérard de Sède, Lincoln claims he was also the one who discovered the Dossiers Secrets, a series of planted genealogies which appeared to further confirm the link with the extinct Merovingian bloodline. The documents claimed that the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar were two fronts of one unified organisation with the same leadership until 1188.\nLetters in existence dating from the 1960s written by Plantard, de Chérisey and de Sède to each other confirm that the three were engaging in an out-and-out hoax.  The letters describe schemes to combat criticisms of their various allegations and ways they would make up new allegations to try to keep the hoax alive. These letters (totalling over 100) are in the possession of French researcher Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who has also retained the original envelopes. A letter later discovered at the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois also indicated that Plantard had a criminal conviction as a con artist.\n\n\n=== The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail ===\n\nAs the Chronicle documentaries on the topic became quite popular and generated thousands of responses, Lincoln then joined forces with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh for further research. This led them to the pseudohistorical Dossiers Secrets at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, which though alleging to portray hundreds of years of medieval history, were actually all written by Plantard and de Chérisey under the pseudonym of \"Philippe Toscan du Plantier\".\nUnaware that the documents had been forged, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh used them as a major source for their 1982 speculative nonfiction book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, in which they presented the following myths as facts to support their hypotheses:\n\nthere is a secret society known as the Priory of Sion, which has a long history starting in 1099, and had illustrious Grand Masters including Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton;\nit created the Knights Templar as its military arm and financial branch; and\nit is devoted to installing the Merovingian dynasty, that ruled the Franks from 457 to 751, on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe.\nThe authors re-interpreted the Dossiers Secrets in the light of their own interest in questioning the Catholic Church's institutional reading of Judeo-Christian history. Contrary to Plantard's initial Franco-Israelist claim that the Merovingians were only descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, they asserted that:\n\nthe Priory of Sion protects Merovingian dynasts because they may be the lineal descendants of the historical Jesus and his alleged wife, Mary Magdalene, traced further back to King David;\nthe legendary Holy Grail is simultaneously the womb of saint Mary Magdalene and the sacred royal bloodline she gave birth to; and\nthe Church tried to kill off all remnants of this bloodline and their supposed guardians, the Cathars and the Templars, so popes could hold the episcopal throne through the apostolic succession of Peter without fear of it ever being usurped by an antipope from the hereditary succession of Mary Magdalene.\nThe authors therefore concluded that the modern goals of the Priory of Sion are:\n\nthe public revelation of the tomb and shrine of Sigebert IV as well as the lost treasure of the Temple in Jerusalem, which supposedly contains genealogical records that prove the Merovingian dynasty was of the Davidic line, to facilitate Merovingian restoration in France;\nthe re-institutionalization of chivalric knighthood and the promotion of pan-European nationalism;\nthe establishment of a theocratic \"United States of Europe\": a Holy European Empire politically and religiously unified through the imperial cult of a Merovingian Great Monarch who occupies both the throne of Europe and the Holy See; and\nthe actual governance of Europe residing with the Priory of Sion through a one-party European Parliament.\nThe authors incorporated the antisemitic and anti-Masonic tract known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into their story, concluding that it was actually based on the master plan of the Priory of Sion. They presented it as the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion by arguing that:\n\nthe original text on which the published version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was based had nothing to do with Judaism or an \"international Jewish conspiracy\". It issued from a Masonic body practicing the Scottish Rite which incorporated the word \"Zion\" in its name;\nthe original text was not intended to be released publicly, but was a program for gaining control of Freemasonry as part of a strategy to infiltrate and reorganize church and state according to esoteric Christian principles;\nafter a failed attempt to gain influence in the court of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Sergei Nilus changed the original text to forge an inflammatory tract in 1903 to discredit the esoteric clique around Papus by implying they were Judaeo-Masonic conspirators; and\nsome esoteric Christian elements in the original text were ignored by Nilus and hence remained unchanged in the antisemitic canard he published.\nIn reaction to this memetic synthesis of investigative journalism with religious conspiracism, many secular conspiracy theorists added the Priory of Sion to their list of secret societies collaborating or competing to manipulate political happenings from behind the scenes in their bid for world domination.  Some occultists speculated that the emergence of the Priory of Sion and Plantard closely follows The Prophecies by M. Michel Nostradamus (unaware that Plantard was intentionally trying to fulfill them). Fringe Christian eschatologists countered that it was a fulfilment of prophecies found in the Book of Revelation and further proof of an anti-Christian conspiracy of epic proportions.\nHistorians and scholars from related fields do not accept The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail as a serious dissertation. French authors like Franck Marie (1978), Pierre Jarnac (1985), (1988), Jean-Luc Chaumeil (1994), and more recently Marie-France Etchegoin and Frédéric Lenoir (2004), Massimo Introvigne (2005), Jean-Jacques Bedu (2005), and Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta (2005), have never taken Plantard and the Priory of Sion as seriously as Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. They eventually concluded that it was all a hoax, outlining in detail the reasons for their verdict, and giving detailed evidence that the Holy Blood authors had not reported comprehensively. They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author Gérard de Sède.\n\n\n=== The Messianic Legacy ===\nIn 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh published The Messianic Legacy, a sequel to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion is not only the archetypal cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics. \nAlthough Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh remain convinced that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion is true, they confess to the possibility that all of Plantard's claims about a post-1956 Priory of Sion were part of an elaborate hoax to become a respected, influential and wealthy player in French esotericist and monarchist circles.\n\n\n=== Revised myth ===\nIn 1989, Plantard tried but failed to salvage his reputation and agenda as a mystagogue in esotericist circles by claiming that the Priory of Sion had actually been founded in 1681 at Rennes-le-Château, and was focused more on harnessing the paranormal power of ley lines and sunrise lines, and a promontory called \"Roc Noir\" (Black Rock) in the area, than installing a Merovingian pretender on the restored throne of France. In 1990, Plantard revised himself by claiming he was only descended from a cadet branch of the line of Dagobert II, while arguing that the direct descendant was really Otto von Habsburg.\n\n\n=== Pelat Affair ===\nIn September 1993, while investigative judge Thierry Jean-Pierre was investigating the activities of multi-millionaire Roger-Patrice Pelat in the context of the Pechiney-Triangle Affair, he was informed that Pelat may have once been Grand Master of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. Pelat's name had been on Plantard's list of Grand Masters since 1989. In fact, Pelat had died in 1989, while he was being indicted for insider trading. Following a long established pattern of using dead people's names, Plantard \"recruited\" the \"initiate\" Pelat soon after his death and included him as the most recent Priory of Sion Grand Master. Plantard had first claimed that Pelat had been a Grand Master in a Priory of Sion pamphlet dated 8 March 1989, then claimed it again later in a 1990 issue of Vaincre, the revived publication of Alpha Galates, a pseudo-chivalric order created by Plantard in Vichy France to support the \"National Revolution\".\nPelat had been a friend of François Mitterrand, then President of France, and at the centre of a scandal involving French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might have led to a scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal pseudo-Masonic lodge named Propaganda Due in the 1982 Banco Ambrosiano bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion. Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.\n\n\n=== Revival attempts ===\nOn 27 December 2002, an open letter announced the revival of the Priory of Sion as an integral traditionalist esoteric society, which stated that: \"The Commanderies of Saint-Denis, Millau, Geneva and Barcelona are fully operative. According to the Tradition, the first Commanderie is under the direction of a woman\", claiming there were 9,841 members. It was signed by Gino Sandri (who claims to be Plantard's former private secretary) under the title of General Secretary, and by \"P. Plantard\" (Le Nautonnier, G. Chyren). Sandri is a well-versed occultist who has spent his life infiltrating esoteric societies only to get expelled from them. After interviewing Sandri, independent researcher Laurent Octonovo Buchholtzer wrote:\n\nI’ve personally met this Gino Sandri on one occasion, and I had the opportunity to have a really good talk with him, but I think that he's simply seeking attention. He seemed to me to be something of a mythomaniac, which would certainly be an excellent qualification for being Secretary of the Priory of Sion. During our conversation he said something in passing that I found quite extraordinary. He said, “Ultimately, what is the Priory of Sion? It's nothing more than a well-known brand name, but with goodness knows what behind it?” He gave a good brief account of the phenomenon of the Priory of Sion. Thanks to Dan Brown, hundreds of millions of people now have “brand awareness”, and several million of them seem to take it seriously.\nSince 2016, Italian  esotericist Marco Rigamonti has claimed to be the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.\n\n\n=== The Da Vinci Code ===\nAs a result of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 conspiracy fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, there was a new level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.\nFurthermore, in their 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh suggested that there was a current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Catholic personal prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there is a conflict between these two groups.\n\n\n=== The Sion Revelation ===\nFurther conspiracy theories were reported in the 2006 non-fiction book The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince (authors of the 1997 non-fiction book The Templar Revelation, the principal source for Dan Brown's claims about hidden messages in the work of Leonardo da Vinci). They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian dynast was a lie. However, they insist that this was part of a complex red herring intended to distract the public from the hidden agenda of Plantard and his \"controllers\". They argue that the Priory of Sion was a front organisation for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a \"United States of Europe\" in line with French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre's synarchist vision of an ideal form of government.\n\n\n=== Bloodline movie ===\nThe 2008 documentary Bloodline by 1244 Films and producers Bruce Burgess, a British filmmaker with an interest in paranormal claims and Rene Barnett, a Los Angeles researcher and television and filmmaker, expands on the \"Jesus bloodline\" hypothesis and other elements of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist codenamed \"Ben Hammott\" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of Rennes-le-Château since 1999; The film speculates that Ben has found the treasure of Bérenger Saunière: a mummified corpse, which Hammott claimed to believe is Mary Magdalene, in an underground tomb purportedly connected to both the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society – Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary, which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis. On 21 March 2012, ahead of an impending public outing on the internet, Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on NightVision Radio, a podcast hosted by Bloodline Producer Rene Barnett (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.\n\n\n== Alleged Grand Masters ==\nThe notional version of the Priory of Sion first referred to during the 1960s was supposedly led by a \"Nautonnier\", an Old French word for a navigator, which means Grand Master in their internal esoteric nomenclature. The following list of Grand Masters is derived from the Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau compiled by Plantard under the nom de plume of \"Philippe Toscan du Plantier\" in 1967. All those named on this list had died before that date. All but two are also found on lists of alleged “Imperators” (supreme heads) and “distinguished members” of the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis that circulated in France at the time when Plantard was in touch with this Rosicrucian Order. Most of those named share the common thread of being known for having an interest in the occult or heresy.\n\nThe Dossiers Secrets asserted that the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar always shared the same Grand Master until a schism occurred during the \"Cutting of the elm\" incident in 1188. Following that event, the Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion are listed in French as being:\n\nJean de Gisors (1188–1220)\nMarie de Saint-Clair (1220–1266)- Marie de Saint-Clair (1192-1266), daughter of Robert de Saint-Clair and Isabel Levis, became Grand Mistress of the Priory from 1220 to her death (3).\nGuillaume de Gisors (1266–1307)\nEdouard de Bar (1307–1336)\nJeanne de Bar (1336–1351)\nJean de Saint-Clair (1351–1366)\nBlanche d'Évreux (1366–1398)\nNicolas Flamel (1398–1418)\nRené d'Anjou (1418–1480)\nIolande de Bar (1480–1483)\nSandro Botticelli (1483–1510)\nLeonardo da Vinci (1510–1519)\nConnétable de Bourbon (1519–1527)\nFerrante I Gonzaga (1527–1575)\nLudovico Gonzaga (1575–1595)\nRobert Fludd (1595–1637)\nJ. Valentin Andrea (1637–1654)\nRobert Boyle (1654–1691)\nIsaac Newton (1691–1727)\nCharles Radclyffe (1727–1746)\nCharles de Lorraine (1746–1780)\nMaximilian de Lorraine (1780–1801)\nCharles Nodier (1801–1844)\nVictor Hugo (1844–1885)\nClaude Debussy (1885–1918)\nJean Cocteau (1918–1963)\nA later document, Le Cercle d'Ulysse, identifies François Ducaud-Bourget, a prominent Traditionalist Catholic priest who Plantard had worked for as a sexton during World War II,  as the Grand Master following Cocteau's death. Plantard himself is later identified as the next Grand Master.\nPierre Plantard rejected the Dossiers Secrets from the late 1980s and gave the Priory of Sion a completely different pedigree. For example the link with the Knights Templar was abolished, although the connection with Godfrey of Bouillon remained. Plantard attempted to make a comeback. The second list appeared in Vaincre No. 3, September 1989, p. 22  which included the names of the deceased Roger-Patrice Pelat, and his own son Thomas Plantard de Saint-Clair:\n\nJean-Tim Negri d'Albes (1681–1703)\nFrançois d'Hautpoul (1703–1726)\nAndré-Hercule de Fleury (1726–1766)\nCharles de Lorraine (1766–1780)\nMaximilian de Lorraine (1780–1801)\nCharles Nodier (1801–1844)\nVictor Hugo (1844–1885)\nClaude Debussy (1885–1918)\nJean Cocteau (1918–1963)\nFrançois Balphangon (1963–1969)\nJohn Drick (1969–1981)\nPierre Plantard de Saint-Clair (1981)\nPhilippe de Chérisey (1984–1985)\nRoger-Patrice Pelat (1985–1989)\nPierre Plantard de Saint-Clair (1989)\nThomas Plantard de Saint-Clair (1989)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Priory of Sion – Ordre de la Rose-Croix Véritas O.D.L.R.C.V.\nPolidoro, Massimo.

        "title": "15-minute city",
        "wikipedia_content": "The 15-minute city (FMC or 15mC) is an urban planning concept in which most daily necessities and services, such as work, shopping, education, healthcare, and leisure can be easily reached by a 15-minute walk, bike ride, or public transit ride from any point in the city. This approach aims to reduce car dependency, promote healthy and sustainable living, and improve wellbeing and quality of life for city dwellers.\nImplementing the 15-minute city concept requires a multi-disciplinary approach, involving transportation planning, urban design, and policymaking, to create well-designed public spaces, pedestrian-friendly streets, and mixed-use development. This change in lifestyle may include remote working which reduces daily commuting and is supported by the recent widespread availability of information and communications technology. The concept has been described as a \"return to a local way of life\".\nAs people spend more time working from home or near their homes, there is less demand for large central office spaces and more need for flexible, local co-working spaces. The 15-minute city concept suggests a shift toward a decentralized network of workspaces within residential neighbourhoods, reducing the need for long commutes and promoting work-life balance.\nThe concept's roots can be traced to pre-modern urban planning traditions where walkability and community living were the primary focus before the advent of street networks and automobiles. In recent times, it builds upon similar pedestrian-centered principles found in New Urbanism, transit-oriented development, and other proposals that promote walkability, mixed-use developments, and compact, livable communities. Numerous models have been proposed about how the concept can be implemented, such as 15-minute cities being built from a series of smaller 5-minute neighborhoods, also known as complete communities or walkable neighborhoods.\nThe concept gained significant traction in recent years after Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo included a plan to implement the 15-minute city concept during her 2020 re-election campaign. Since then, a number of cities worldwide have adopted the same goal and many researchers have used the 15-minute model as a spatial analysis tool to evaluate accessibility levels within the urban fabric.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 15-minute city concept is derived from historical ideas about proximity and walkability, such as Clarence Perry's neighborhood unit. As an inspiration for the 15-minute city, Carlos Moreno, an advisor to Anne Hidalgo, cited Jane Jacobs's model presented in The Death and Life of Great American Cities.\nThe ongoing climate crisis and global COVID-19 pandemic have prompted a heightened focus on the 15-minute city concept. In July 2020, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group published a framework for cities to \"build back better\" using the 15-minute concept, referring specifically to plans implemented in Milan, Madrid, Edinburgh, and Seattle after COVID-19 outbreaks. Their report highlights the importance of inclusive community engagement through mechanisms like participatory budgeting and adjusting city plans and infrastructure to encourage dense, complete, overall communities.\nA manifesto published in Barcelona in April 2020 by architecture theorist Massimo Paolini proposed radical change in the organization of cities in the wake of COVID-19, and was signed by 160 academics and 300 architects. The proposal has four key elements: reorganization of mobility, (re)naturalization of the city, de-commodification of housing, and de-growth.\nIn early 2023, far-right conspiracy theories began to flourish that described 15-minute cities as instruments of government repression, claiming that they were a pretext to introduce restrictions on travel by car. In fact, the '15-minute city' proposals do not involve any restrictions on travel by car –  unrelated measures introduced to reduce traffic in some cities have been somehow confused with '15-minute cities'.\n\n\n== Research models ==\n\nThe 15-minute city is a proposal for developing a polycentric city, where density is made pleasant, one's proximity is vibrant, and social intensity (a large number of productive, intricately linked social ties) is real. The key element of the model has been described by Carlos Moreno as \"chrono-urbanism\" or a refocus of interest on time value rather than time cost.\n\n\n=== Moreno and the 15-minute city ===\nUrbanist Carlos Moreno's 2021 article introduced the 15-minute city concept as a way to ensure that urban residents can fulfill six essential functions within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their dwellings: living, working, commerce, healthcare, education and entertainment. The framework of this model has four components; density, proximity, diversity and digitalization.\nMoreno cites the work of Nikos Salingaros, who theorizes that an optimal density for urban development exists which would encourage local solutions to local problems. The authors discuss proximity in terms of both space and time, arguing that a 15-minute city would reduce the space and time necessary for activity. Diversity in this 15-minute city model refers to mixed-use development and multicultural neighborhoods, both of which Moreno and others argue would improve the urban experience and boost community participation in the planning process. Digitalization is a key aspect of the 15-minute city derived from smart cities. Moreno and others argue that a Fourth Industrial Revolution has reduced the need for commuting because of access to technology like virtual communication and online shopping. They conclude by stating that these four components, when implemented at scale, would form an accessible city with a high quality of life.\n\n\n=== Larson and the 20-minute city ===\nKent Larson described the concept of a 20-minute city in a 2012 TED talk, and his City Science Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed a neighborhood simulation platform to integrate the necessary design, technology, and policy interventions into \"compact urban cells\". In his \"On Cities\" masterclass for the Norman Foster Foundation, Larson proposed that the planet is becoming a network of cities, and that successful cities in the future will evolve into a network of high-performance, resilient, entrepreneurial communities.\n\n\n=== D'Acci and the one-mile city ===\nIn 2013, Luca D'Acci (Associate Professor in Urban Studies at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy) proposed a city model \"where each point can reach continuous natural areas, job locations, centralities, shops, amenities (recreational, medical, cultural), usual daily activities by 15/30 minute walking or within 15 minute biking\". He called it a \"one-mile green city\", or \"Isobenefit Urbanism\". (The term \"isobenefit\" is a portmanteau word from \"iso\" meaning equal, and \"benefit\", which he defines as advantageous amenities, services, workplaces and green space.)\n\n\n=== Weng and the 15-minute walkable neighborhood ===\nIn a 2019 article using Shanghai as a case study, Weng and his colleagues proposed the 15-minute walkable neighborhood with a focus on health, and specifically non-communicable diseases. The authors suggest that the 15-minute walkable neighborhood is a way to improve the health of residents, and they document existing disparities in walkability within Shanghai. They found that rural areas, on average, are significantly less walkable, and areas with low walkability tend to have a higher proportion of children. Compared to Moreno et al., the authors focused more on the health benefits of walking and differences in walkability and usage across age groups.\n\n\n=== Da Silva and the 20-minute city ===\nIn their 2019 article, Da Silva et al. cite Tempe, Arizona, as a case study of an urban space where all needs could be met within 20 minutes by walking, biking, or transit. The authors found that Tempe is highly accessible, especially by bike, but that accessibility varies with geographic area. Compared to Moreno et al., the authors focused more on accessibility within the built environment.\n\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n\n=== Asia ===\nIn 2019, Singapore's Land Transport Authority proposed a master plan that included the goals of \"20-minute towns\" and a \"45-minute city\" by 2040.\nIsrael has embraced the concept of a 15-minute city in new residential developments. According to Orli Ronen, the head of the Urban Innovation and Sustainability Lab at the Porter School for Environmental Studies at Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Beersheba, and central Jerusalem have been effective in delivering on the concept at least in part in new developments, but only Tel Aviv has been relatively successful.\nDubai launched the 20-minute city project in 2022, where residents are able to access daily needs & destinations within 20 minutes by foot or bicycle.  The plan involves placing 55% of the residents within 800 meters of mass transit stations, allowing them to reach 80% of their daily needs and destinations.\nIn the Philippine's largest city, the government of Quezon City announced in 2023 its plans to implement the 15-minute city concept to establish a walkable, people-friendly, and sustainable community for its residents. Influenced by the city of Paris, the government aims to make urban development people-centered and to further reach the city's goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n\n==== China ====\nThe 2016 Master Plan for Shanghai called for \"15-minute community life circles\", where residents could complete all of their daily activities within 15 minutes of walking. The community life circle has been implemented in other Chinese cities, like Baoding and Guangzhou. Xiong'an is also being developed under the 15-minute life circle concept.\nThe Standard for urban residential area planning and design (GB 50180–2018), a national standard that came into effect in 2018, stipulates four levels of residential areas: 15-min pedestrian-scale neighborhood, 10-min pedestrian-scale neighborhood, 5-min pedestrian-scale neighborhood, and a neighborhood block. Among them, \"15-min pedestrian-scale neighborhood\" means \"residential area divided according to the principle that residents can meet their material, living and cultural demand by walking for 15 minutes; usually surrounded by urban trunk roads or site boundaries, with a population of 50,000 to 100,000 people (about 17,000 to 32,000 households) and complete supporting facilities.\"\nChengdu, to combat urban sprawl, commissioned the \"Great City\" plan, where development on the edges of the city would be dense enough to support all necessary services within a 15-minute walk.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nThe mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, introduced the 15-minute city concept in her 2020 re-election campaign and began implementing it during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, school playgrounds were converted to parks after school hours, while the Place de la Bastille and other squares have been revamped with trees and bicycle lanes.\nCagliari, a city on the Italian island of Sardinia, began a strategic plan to revitalize the city and improve walkability. The city actively solicited public feedback through a participatory planning process, as described in the Moreno model. A unique aspect of the plan calls for re-purposing public spaces and buildings that were no longer being used, relating to the general model of urban intensification.\nIn Utrecht, the fourth-largest city in the Netherlands, 100 percent of residents can reach all city necessities in a 15-minute bike ride, and 94% in a 10-minute bike ride. The local municipality has plans to improve this further by 2040.\nIn September 2023, the UK Government announced plans to \"protect drivers from over-zealous traffic enforcement\", in what it says is \"part of a long-term plan to back drivers\". These included plans \"to stop councils implementing so called '15-minute cities', by consulting on ways to prevent schemes which aggressively restrict where people can drive\".\nPolish city Pleszew is claimed to be a 15-minute city.\nCopenhagen's Nordhavn neighbourhood was developed according to a five-minute city concept. This is based on all daily amenities being located at a distance of 400 m from the nearest public transit stop – a distance walkable within 5 minutes.\n\n\n=== North America ===\nIn 2012, Portland, Oregon, developed a plan for complete neighborhoods within the city, which are aimed at supporting youth, providing affordable housing, and promoting community-driven development and commerce in historically under-served neighborhoods. Similar to the Weng et al. model, the Portland plan emphasizes walking and cycling as ways to increase overall health and stresses the importance of the availability of affordable healthy food. The Portland plan calls for a high degree of transparency and community engagement during the planning process, which is similar to the diversity component of the Moreno et al. model.\nIn 2015, Kirkland, Washington, developed a \"10-Minute Neighborhood Analysis\" tool to guide the city's 2035 Comprehensive Plan. This tool is intended to guide community discussion about how the 10-Minute Neighborhood concept can improve livability and explore the policy changes necessary to achieve that vision.\n\n\n=== South America ===\nIn March 2021, Bogotá, Colombia, implemented 84 kilometers of bike lanes to encourage social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This expansion complemented the Ciclovía practice that originated in Colombia in 1974, where bicycles are given primary control of the streets. The resulting bicycle lane network is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\n\n=== Oceania ===\nThe city of Melbourne, Australia, developed Plan Melbourne 2017–2050 to accommodate growth and combat sprawl. The plan contains multiple elements of the 15-minute city concept, including new bike lanes and the construction of \"20-minute neighborhoods\".\n\n\n== Societal effects ==\nThe 15-minute city, with its emphasis on walkability and accessibility, has been put forward as a way to better serve groups of people that have historically been left out of planning, such as women, children, people with disabilities, people with lived experience of mental illness, and the elderly.\nSocial infrastructure is also emphasized to maximize urban functions such as schools, parks, and complementary activities for residents. There is also a large focus on access to green space, which may promote positive environmental impacts such as increasing urban biodiversity and helping to protect the city from invasive species. Studies have found that increased access to green spaces can also have a positive impact on the mental and physical health of a city's inhabitants, reducing stress and negative emotions, increasing happiness, improving sleep, and promoting positive social interactions. Urban residents living near green spaces have also been found to exercise more, improving their physical and mental health.\n\n\n== Limitations ==\nLimitations of the 15-minute city concept include the difficulty or impracticality of implementing the 15-minute city concept in established urban areas, where land use patterns and infrastructure are already in place. Additionally, the concept may not be feasible in areas with low population density, such as those with extensive urban sprawl, or in areas where lower-income workers commute long distances to or from.\nNoted exceptions include Chengdu, which used the 15-minute city concept to curb sprawl, and Melbourne, where Lord Mayor Sally Capp stressed the importance of public transit in expanding the radius of the 15-minute city.\nIn a paper published in the journal Sustainability, Georgia Pozoukidou and Zoi Chatziyiannaki write that the creation of dense, walkable urban cores often leads to gentrification or displacement of lower-income residents to outlying neighborhoods due to rising property values; to counteract this, the authors argue for affordable housing provisions to be integral with 15-minute city policies.\nFurthermore, when the concept is applied as a literal spatial analysis research tool, it then refers to the use of an isochrone to express the radius of an area considered local. Isochrones have a long history of use in transportation planning and are constructed primarily using two variables: time and speed. However, the reliance on population-wide conventions, such as gait speed, to estimate the buffer zones of accessible areas may not accurately reflect the mobility capabilities of specific population groups, like the elderly. This may result in potential inaccuracies and fallacies in research models.\n\n\n=== Obstacles to implementation ===\nIn the United States, several factors make the implementation of 15-minute cities challenging.  The biggest roadblock is strict zoning regulations, especially single-family zoning which makes high density housing construction illegal.  NIMBYism is also an obstacle, as are parking requirements and the perceived low quality of urban schools which causes childbearing couples to move from urban areas to suburban areas.\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\nIn 2023 conspiracy theories about the 15-minute concept began to flourish, which described the model as an instrument of government oppression. These claims are often part of or linked to other conspiracy theories such as QAnon, anti-vaccine theories or anti-5G misinformation that assert that Western governments seek to oppress their populations. Proponents of the 15-minute concept, including Carlos Moreno, have received death threats.\nSome conspiracy theorists conflate the 15-minute concept with the British low-traffic neighbourhood approach, which includes license plate scanners in some implementations. This has led to assertions that the 15-minute model would fine residents for leaving their home districts, or that it would confine people in \"open-air prisons\". Conspiracy theorists believe the World Economic Forum (WEF) wants to lock people in their homes on the pretext of climate change. Such beliefs are part of a larger network of conspiracy theories surrounding the concept of a \"Great Reset\".\nIn a 2023 protest by some 2,000 demonstrators in Oxford, signs described 15-minute cities as \"ghettos\" and an instrument of \"tyrannical control\" by the WEF. Canadian media commentator Jordan Peterson has described 15-minute cities as a \"perversion\". QAnon supporters have claimed a February 2023 derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals in Ohio was part of a deliberate plot to force rural residents into 15-minute cities to restrict their personal freedom. Similar claims have been made about wildfires on the island of Maui in August 2023.\nIn 2023, the British Conservative government began to criticise the idea by name. In February 2023 the Conservative MP Nick Fletcher called 15-minute cities an \"international socialist concept\" during a debate in the UK Parliament, which was met with laughter. At the Conservative party conference in October 2023, Transport Secretary Mark Harper announced that he was \"calling time on the misuse of so-called '15-minute cities'\", criticising as \"sinister\" the idea that local councils could \"decide how often you go to the shops and that they ration who uses the roads and when\". No such powers have been proposed as part of the 15-minute city concept in the United Kingdom. Despite being specifically debunked in a guide given to MPs by the Leader of the House of Commons, Health Secretary Maria Caulfield included the fiction in a local election leaflet and reiterated it in a BBC interview.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFranqueville, Pierre (2014). \"La bibliothèque dans la ville : du chrono-urbanisme à la chrono-bibliothéconomie\".

        "title": "Vril Society",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Vril Society was a fictitious secret society that is said to have existed in Germany in the early to mid-twentieth century. In a series of conspiracy theory and pseudohistorical texts claim that it was involved in the rise of Nazism and used supernatural energies to develop innovative flying machines during the Nazi era or \"Reichsflugscheiben\". There is no historical evidence for the existence of a secret society of this name and the achievements attributed to it. Likewise, there is no evidence for the historical significance attributed by representatives of this legend to the \"Vril Society\" and some actually existing occult groups.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== The novel The Coming Race and the term Vril ===\n\nThe word Vril comes from the novel The Coming Race published in 1871 by the English writer Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873) and was probably derived from the Latin word virilis (manly', 'powerful'). In this novel, the narrator encounters a subterranean race of humans, the Vril-Ya, who possess a psychic vital energy called Vril that is far superior to that of the human race. The Vril powers enable them to use telepathy and telekinesis and allow them to influence any form of animate or inanimate matter to heal, raise the dead or destroy. Originally a people who lived on the surface of the earth, the Vril-ya were cut off from the rest of humanity by a natural disaster and moved into an underground cave system where they found a new home. There, in a history marked by wars and social upheaval, they eventually evolved into an egalitarian society practicing eugenics, superior to all other races, through the discovery of a new force of nature - the Vril Force. Through contact with the novel's narrator, the Vril-ya learn about the humans living on the surface of the Earth and question him in detail about human society. The narrator manages to escape from the realm of the Vril-ya and at the end of the novel he warns his readers of the danger that the Vril-ya would pose to humanity if they were ever to return to the surface.\n\n\n=== Vril in Theosophy and popular theories ===\n\nWhile contemporary critics saw The Coming Race as satire, other sections of the public regarded it as an occultist roman à clef. In these circles, the view was held that Bulwer-Lytton was a member of the Rosicrucians and that the \"Vril\" force was an actually existing universal life force. According to this view, the novel was merely a vehicle with which Bulwer-Lytton wanted to communicate secret knowledge to his readers under the guise of anonymity.\nHelena Blavatsky and other occult authors adopted the term \"Vril\" as a synonym for secret natural forces that could only be used by magic. In Blavatsky's first work Isis unveiled (1877), Vril was portrayed as a real, independent force.\nIn her second book The Secret Doctrine in 1888, she described how the inhabitants of Atlantis had used Vril to build colossal structures. After the fall of Atlantis, a small group of surviving priests would have preserved this knowledge and only passed it on to a select few. This psychic energy should therefore allow the mastery of all of nature. Several books mention a Vril-ya Club founded in London in 1904, which is said to have addressed this issue. Bulwer-Lytton's writings are passed on in the New Thought movement.\nIt was particularly momentous that the theosophist William Scott-Elliot described the vril in his 1896 pamphlet The Story of Atlantis in connection with airships, which it served as the driving force behind. This characteristic of the vril, already described in The Coming Race, became a main reference for certain developments after World War II due to Scott-Elliot's explicit Atlantis association.\n\n\n=== The further reception ===\nAs early as the mid-1890s, new scientific discoveries, such as the discovery of X-rays, led to the widespread view, even among intellectuals, that science could not yet claim to have finally solved the world's mysteries and that invisible natural forces and energies still existed. Occult theories were not only cited as counter-concepts to natural science, but common thematic points of contact were also identified. Many occult circles responded to the unease caused by the materialism of scientific and technological modernity by attempting to formulate a doctrine of the control of earthly and cosmic forces that was on a par with the natural sciences.\nAround 1900, the fields of occultism and mysticism experienced a great upswing that lasted until the 1930s. As Theosophy was widespread at this time of the revival of occult movements, the \"Vril\" concept was also familiar in occult circles in Germany. Bulwer-Lytton's primal force appeared above all in contexts involving the creation of a \"magic technique\", whose designs expressed the desire for a unification of science and religion. A total of four translations of Bulwer-Lytton's book were published in Germany between 1874 and 1924, including one, which Anthroposophist Guenther Wachsmuth at the request of Rudolf Steiner. The term \"Vril\" therefore became known to a wider public in Germany until the 1920s. As a result, lay theories flourished, claiming to be able to fill alleged gaps in the sciences, without taking into account that Bulwer-Lytton only wanted to write an entertainment novel in the style of Jules Verne.\n\n\n== Development and content of the legends about the Vril societies ==\n\n\n=== Historical templates ===\nBefore World War II, there was at least one private circle in Berlin whose members were explicitly involved with the \"Vril\" force. The few sources that prove the existence of this circle of people later became one of the starting points for the creation of the Vril society legend.\n\n\n==== The \"truth society\" ====\n\nOne of the sources of evidence for the existence of such a group is an article by the German rocket pioneer Willy Ley, which he published in 1947 in the American science fiction magazine Astounding Science Fiction. In it, he attempts to explain to his readers why National Socialism was able to fall on fertile ground in Germany and attributes this to the great popularity of irrational beliefs in pre-war Germany. He describes various examples of pseudoscience and esoteric currents and in this context also mentions what he sees as a particularly peculiar group:\n\n\"The next group was literally based on a novel. This group, which I believe was called the Truth Society and was more or less based in Berlin, devoted their spare time to the search for Vril. Yes, their beliefs were based on Bulwer-Lytton's The Coming Race. They knew the book was a fabrication, Bulwer-Lytton had used this artifice to tell the truth about this 'force'. Subterranean humanity was nonsense, Vril was not. Possibly it had enabled the British, who guarded it as a state secret, to build their colonial empire. Certainly the Romans possessed it, encased in small metal spheres that protected their homes and were referred to as lares. For reasons I could not see through, the secret of the Vril could be discovered by immersing oneself in contemplating the structure of an apple cut in half. No, I am not joking, this was what I was told with great solemnity and secrecy. Such a group actually existed; it even published the first issue of a magazine in which it proclaimed its credo. (I wished I'd kept some of these things, but as it was, I had enough books to smuggle out).\"\n\n\n==== \"Reich working group 'The coming Germany'\" ====\nIn 1930, two smaller pamphlets entitled Weltdynamismus were published and Vril. Die kosmische Urkraft, which were published by an occult circle that called itself the \"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft 'Das kommende Deutschland'\" (RAG).\nIn it, the RAG claimed to have an elaborate technology that was suitable for utilizing the \"Vril\" force. The structure and functional principle of the machine described and the political program outlined are almost identical in structure and content to a brochure published by two Austrian authors as early as 1928, which propagated a perpetuum mobile that the Austrian Karl Schappeller is said to have invented. The RAG plans only differ from this in a few details. Overall, the impression is created that this is an improved version of Schappeller's machine, the function of which is not explained in (pseudo-)physical terms, but in occult terms. In a longer section of one of the texts, the image of an apple cut in half is used as a model for the structure of the earth and its connection with the \"space force\". This and the contributions by proven Schappeller supporters suggest that it was primarily followers of the Austrian inventor who contributed to the RAG publications.\n\nFrom another RAG publication, of the Zeitschrift für Weltdynamismus, it becomes clear that RAG was founded in Berlin in 1930 by a certain Johannes Täufer. Täufer was also responsible for the brochure \"Vril\". Die kosmische Urkraft, but nothing more is known about his person. The name is probably a pseudonym, and it has been suggested that it may have been the publisher Otto Wilhelm Barth, who had published two of the RAG publications. Fritz Klein, a patron of Schappeller whose writings were recommended by RAG, may also have been behind this.\n\n\n==== Summary of the research situation ====\nA comparison between Ley's memoirs and the contents of the RAG writings leads to the conclusion that the \"Truth Society\" and the RAG could actually have been the same group. However, it seems to have only had a short-term and marginal significance in the occult scene of the time. There is no evidence of RAG in official registers, nor are there any records of its publications at the time in the archives of the Otto Wilhelm Barth publishing house. No further issues of either the Zeitschrift für Weltdynamismus or the Archiv für Alchemistische Forschung, which was published jointly with it, appeared. No documents exist for the period after 1930 that prove RAG's continued existence or influence on other circles. Nor can RAG's claim that it possessed \"Vril\" technology be regarded as proof that it actually succeeded in using it. Above all, however, it does not seem to be relevant to the invention of a Vril company after 1945 whether Willy Ley had actually referred to RAG: as will become clear below, later authors were at best inspired by Ley's statements for their own fantasies. Nonetheless, this group later formed a central building block for justifying the legends of the secret activities of a \"Vril Society\" in Germany from the 1920s to the 1940s.\n\n\n=== Origin of the legends ===\nIn the period after the Second World War, numerous conspiracy theory and pseudohistorical interpretations of the Third Reich developed. pseudo-historical interpretations of the Third Reich, in which occult elements played a central role. In this context, the \"Vril\" concept and the aforementioned references to occultist groups were also cited as historical evidence. The earliest reference to an alleged secret society with the name \"Vril Society\" can be found in a publication from 1960. Since then, the topic has been taken up again and again in several variations in conspiracy theory and esoteric literature. literature again and again. While the first versions of this legend still rejected National Socialism, more recent versions of the legend directly or indirectly serve a positive reinterpretation of the Third Reich.\n\n\n==== Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier ====\nThe existence of a \"vril society\" was first claimed by the French authors Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier. In their book Le matin des magiciens (Departure into the third millennium), published in 1960, they represented the thesis that the Nazi leadership attempted to enter into alliances with supernatural powers. An occult secret society had played a central role in these efforts. Referring to the statements of Willy Ley and on the basis of research they had allegedly carried out themselves but not specified further, they claimed that this society had called itself the \"Vril Society\" or \"The Lodge of the Brothers of the Light\" (Luminous Lodge). The \"Vril Society\" maintained close contacts with the Theosophical Society, the Rosicrucians and in particular the Thule Society and was an important Nazi organization.\n\n\n==== Criticism ====\nThe sect that Ley recalls bears only a superficial resemblance to the \"Vril Society\" of the book Dawn of the Third Millennium. The authors never provided further evidence for their far-reaching speculations, not even for the alleged names of this group. Their claims must therefore be classified as fictions. In addition, historical research came to the conclusion that the occult groups existing at the time (for example the Thule Society) did not exert any significant influence on Hitler and the NSDAP. Although connections between occult ideas and the world view of individual National Socialists (especially Himmler) can be proven, they do not support the thesis that these occult circles had a comprehensive, systematic influence on Hitler and the entire National Socialist leadership.\nPauwels and Bergier's book inspired other authors to speculate about the alleged role of the \"Vril Society\", such as J. H. Brennan or Trevor Ravenscroft. They also claim that there were close ties between the Thule Society, the Vril Society and the Nazi leadership, but this is based on conjecture and pseudo-facts.\n\n\n==== Norbert Jürgen-Ratthofer / Ralf Ettl and Jan Udo Holey ====\nIn the 1990s, the legend of the \"Vril Society\" was further developed. Norbert Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl linked them in 1992 in their publication The Vril Project mit dem älteren Mythos der „NS-Flugscheiben\". According to them, the \"Vril Society\" had developed from the Thule Society and pursued esoteric studies. In the early 1920s, the Aldebarans made telepathic contact with it and with an inner circle of the SS, through which they received plans to build a flying machine. In 1922, the \"Vril Society\" is said to have used this information to build a saucer-shaped flying ship, the so-called \"Beyond Flying Machine\". Through various intermediate steps, in which the Austrian inventor Viktor Schauberger is said to have been involved, this then allegedly led to the construction of a version (\"V7\"), in which members of the \"Vril Society\" are said to have traveled to Aldebaran in 1945. In addition, further saucer-shaped aircraft (with names such as \"Vril\" and \"Haunebu\") were allegedly developed, with the help of which members of the Vril Society and the SS finally set off for Antarctic New Swabia in 1945.\n\nJürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl were members of the so-called Tempelhof Society, which had been active since the 1980s under the aegis of its \"grand commander\" Hans-Günter Fröhlich. The Tempelhof Society brought out several small publications and organized regular meetings that demonstrated its connections to the German-speaking right-wing extremist network of the time. The first comprehensive publication of the Tempelhof Society appeared in 1987 under the title Einblick in die magische Weltsicht und die magischen Prozesse (Insight into the magical world view and the magical processes). Excerpts from this publication and from articles in the right-wing extremist magazine CODE prove that an exchange took place between the members of the Tempelhof Society and the circle around Wilhelm Landig, which mainly revolved around the Sumerian/Babylonian origins of the Germans and the concept of the Black Sun. The publications of the Tempelhof Society were instrumental in linking this esoteric concept of the Black Sun, which had been discussed in the circle around Landig since the 1950s.\nThe text Das Vril-Projekt (The Vril Project), published by the Tempelhof Society, was originally little known. The legend attracted greater attention when it was taken up by Jan Udo Holey and reached a wider readership through his books. Holey, who is associated with brown esotericism, published the book Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20. Jahrhundert (Secret Societies and their Power in the 20th Century) in 1993 under the pseudonym \"Jan van Helsing\", which is said to have sold 100,000 copies by 1996 alone. In it, he reproduces the scenario by Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl, but without clearly identifying their authorship. Her writing is listed in Holey's bibliography, but there is no reference to her authorship in the relevant chapter. In his 1997 book Unternehmen Aldebaran, Holey repeated this scenario and expanded it with more extensive references to Nazi UFOs and secret bases in the Antarctic.\nVariations of this legend can also be found in more recent publications by other authors, e.g. Heiner Gehring and Karl-Heinz Zunneck, in the Study Buddhism, in Arcanorum Causam Nostrum, with Armin Risi and not least Henry Stevens.\nOther variations of the legend focus more strongly on the alleged role of a woman, who was already mentioned in 1992 in the Vril Project by Jürgen-Ratthofer and Ettl and also later at Holey was mentioned: a medium named Maria Oršić. According to the Vril Project, Maria Oršić from Zagreb (Croatia) was involved in the founding of the \"Vril Society\" and also established the spiritualist contact with the Aldebarans.\nIn a later text, which only circulates anonymously on the internet, the figure of Maria Oršić is transformed from a minor character into a central protagonist. This text claims that Maria Oršić, a native of Vienna, founded the \"All German Society for Metaphysics\" in Munich in 1919 or 1921, which was linked to the \"Vril Society\". According to this text, the originally only female members of this society were involved with magical energies that were connected to the \"Vril force\". The protest against the short hair fashion of the 1920s and the wearing of long hairstyles played an important role in connection with the use of these \"vibrational magical\" energies. These energies were also used to power so-called \"otherworldly flying machines\", in the construction of which they were involved. According to the text, the \"Alldeutsche Gesellschaft für Metaphysik\" later formed the \"Antriebstechnische Werkstätten\". There, other scientists and technicians, including a Munich professor named \"W. O. Schumann\", were involved in the development of Reichsflugscheibes and other armaments projects.\nAfter the dissolution of the Tempelhof Society, Ralf Ettl founded the Causa Nostra circle of friends, which continues to disseminate such ideas to this day, sometimes in a modified form. Causa Nostra also maintains links with the Swiss publisher Unitall, whose publications incorporate the ideas of the Tempelhof Society / Causa Nostra in the form of novels and non-fiction books.\n\n\n==== Criticism ====\nThe myth of the Nazi UFOs arose independently of the aforementioned authors and was essentially inspired by the writings of Miguel Serrano, Ernst Zündel and Wilhelm Landig characterized. The graphic representations of German flying disks circulating today are mostly based on drawings that were distributed in the 1980s by Ralf Ettl's Abraxas Videofilm Produktionsgesellschaft mbH and first published by D. H. Haarmann and O. Bergmann. The drawings were apparently inspired by the photos in George Adamski's UFO classics.\nThere is a complete lack of verifiable evidence for the scenarios described; the books contain only a few illustrations of questionable origin. There is no substantiated evidence for the references to the groups discussed above or to real people from contemporary history. The authors refer to messages transmitted by the media and anonymous informants (cf. e.g.), that defy all scrutiny. The topic seems to be particularly well received in circles of right-wing esotericism or esoteric neo-Nazism. A characteristic feature of this trend, which has been observable for some years now, is that the \"Third Reich\" is being reinterpreted and positively valorized from the perspective of esoteric world views. Concepts originally developed there, such as the Black Sun, have now also had a significant influence on popular culture outside these circles, as can be seen in computer games such as Wolfenstein.\nNo reputable sources were provided on the life and work of Maria Oršić and the members of the society she allegedly led. Nevertheless, in the wake of the publications of the \"right-wing extremist esotericist\" Jan Udo Holey wrote a series of neo-pagan and, in part, neo-Nazi publications, secret societies, as well as a novel based on facts about the life and work of Maria Oršić and the \"Vril Society\".\nNot least through a publication by the authors Peter Bahn and Heiner Gehring, in which an attempt was made to support the concept of a \"primal energy\" underlying all other forms of energy by referring to the historical tradition of this concept, the topics of \"Vril\" power and \"Vril society\" also attracted attention in those circles that believe in the reality of so-called \"free energy\". However, the \"Vril\" concept was also used by representatives of \"brown esotericism\" for a positive reinterpretation of the \"Third Reich\". For example, references to Bahn and Gehring's interpretation of the RAG can be found in the publications of the Sonnenwacht association, which, according to critics, \"uses neo-pagan esotericism as a cover for right-wing extremism\".\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n=== Literature on the background and criticism of the legends ===\nAlan Baker: Invisible eagle.

        "title": "Phantom time conspiracy theory",
        "wikipedia_content": "The phantom time conspiracy theory is a pseudohistorical conspiracy theory first asserted by Heribert Illig in 1991. It hypothesizes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retroactively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence. According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a \"phantom time\" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages. \nEvidence contradicts the hypothesis and it failed to gain the support of historians, and calendars in other European countries, most of Asia and parts of pre-Columbian America contradict this.\n\n\n== Heribert Illig ==\nIllig was born in 1947 in Vohenstrauß, Bavaria. He was active in an association dedicated to Immanuel Velikovsky, catastrophism and historical revisionism, the Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte (English: Society for the Reconstruction of Human and Natural History). From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart (English: Prehistory-Proto-History-Present). Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, Mantis-Verlag, and publishing his own journal, Zeitensprünge (English: Leaps in Time). Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of Egon Friedell.\nBefore focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt. His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 Das erfundene Mittelalter (English: The Invented Middle Ages) also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.\nIn 1997, the journal Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften (English: Ethics and Social Sciences) offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.\nAfter 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as pseudohistory in German popular media.\nIllig continued to publish on the \"phantom time hypothesis\" until at least 2013.\nAlso in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of art history, on German Renaissance master Anton Pilgram, but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of Mannerism.\n\n\n== Claims ==\n\nIllig's claims include:\n\nThat there is a scarcity of archaeological evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911.\nThat the dating methods used for such recent periods, radiometry and dendrochronology, are inaccurate.\nThat medieval historians rely too much on written sources.\nThat the presence of Romanesque architecture in tenth-century Western Europe suggests that the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.\nThat at the time of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in AD 1582, there should have been a discrepancy of thirteen days between the Julian calendar and the real (or tropical) calendar, when the astronomers and mathematicians working for Pope Gregory XIII had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. From this, Illig concludes that the AD era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.\n\n\n== Refutation ==\nObservations in ancient astronomy, especially those of solar eclipses cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology), agree with the usual chronology and not with Illig's. Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to question the hypothesis. One is reported by Pliny the Elder in 59 AD. This date has a confirmed eclipse. In addition, observations during the Tang dynasty in China, and Halley's Comet, for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no \"phantom time\" added.\nArchaeological remains and dating methods such as dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) refute, rather than support, \"phantom time\".\nThe Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325 AD, the time of the Council of Nicaea, which had established a method for determining the date of Easter Sunday by fixing the vernal equinox on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's \"three missing centuries\" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.\nIf Charlemagne and the Carolingian dynasty were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe during the same era, including Anglo-Saxon England, the Papacy, and the Byzantine Empire. The \"phantom time\" period also encompasses the life of Muhammad and the Islamic expansion into the areas of the former Western Roman Empire, including the conquest of Visigothic Iberia. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the Tang dynasty of China and its contact with the Islamic world, such as at the Battle of Talas.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPublications by Illig:\n\nEgon Friedell und Immanuel Velikovsky.

        "title": "Time Cube",
        "wikipedia_content": "Time Cube was a pseudoscientific personal web page set up in 1997 by Otis Eugene \"Gene\" Ray. It was a self-published outlet for Ray's \"theory of everything\", also called \"Time Cube\", which claims that all modern sciences are participating in a worldwide conspiracy to omit his theory, which posits that each day actually consists of four days occurring simultaneously. Ray described himself as the \"wisest man on earth\" and a \"godlike being with superior intelligence who has absolute evidence and proof\" for his views. Ray asserted repeatedly and variously that the academic world had not taken Time Cube seriously.\nAccording to Find a Grave, Ray died on 18 March 2015, and the Time Cube website registration expired in August 2015.\n\n\n== Website ==\nThe Time Cube website did not have a home page. A large amount of self-invented jargon is used throughout, often never defined. In one paragraph, Ray claimed that his own wisdom \"so antiquates known knowledge\" that a psychiatrist examining his behavior diagnosed him with schizophrenia.\nAdi Robertson of The Verge commented that Ray's theory of time is \"an incredibly confusing one peppered with racism and homophobia\".\n\n\n== Time Cube concept ==\n\nRay's personal model of reality, called \"Time Cube\", states that all of modern physics and education is wrong, and argues that, among many other things, Greenwich Time is a global conspiracy. He uses various graphs (along with pictures of himself) that purport to show how each day is really four separate days—SUN-UP, MID-DAY, SUN-DOWN, and MID-NIGHT (formerly morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, and evening)—occurring simultaneously.\nThe following quotation from the website illustrates the recurring theme:\n\nWhen the Sun shines upon Earth, 2 – major Time points are created on opposite sides of Earth – known as Midday and Midnight. Where the 2 major Time forces join, synergy creates 2 new minor Time points we recognize as Sunup and Sundown. The 4-equidistant time points can be considered as Time Square imprinted upon the circle of Earth. In a single rotation of the Earth sphere, each Time corner point rotates through the other 3-corner Time points, thus creating 16 corners, 96 hours, and 4-simultaneous 24-hour Days within a single rotation of Earth – equated to a Higher Order of Life Time Cube.\nRay offered $1,000 or $10,000 to anyone who could prove his views wrong.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRay spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2002 as part of a student-organized extra-curricular event during the independent activities period. He repeated his $10,000 offer for professors to disprove his notions at the event; none attempted it. John C. Dvorak wrote in PC Magazine that \"Metasites that track crackpot sites often say this is the number one nutty site.\" He also characterized the site's content as \"endless blather.\" When asked by Martin Sargent in 2003 how it felt to be an Internet celebrity, Ray stated that it was not a position he wanted, but something he felt he had to do as \"no writer or speaker understands the Time Cube.\" Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the Georgia Institute of Technology in April 2005, delivering a speech in which he attacked the instruction offered by academics.\nIn 2005, Brett Hanover made Above God, a short documentary film about Ray and Time Cube. The film was likely named after one of Ray's websites, which criticized the idea that God exists. Hanover's film won awards for Best Documentary at the Indie Memphis Film Festival and the Atlanta Underground Film Festival.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe song \"To the End of the World\" on Alestorm's 2017 album No Grave But the Sea makes several references to the Time Cube concept.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website archived at the Wayback Machine on May 6, 2015\nGene Ray interviewed on Tech TV\n\"Otis Eugene Ray (1927-2015) - Find a Grave...\" Find a Grave.

        "title": "Trilateral Commission",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Trilateral Commission is a nongovernmental international organization aimed at fostering closer cooperation between Japan, Western Europe and North America. It was founded in July 1973, principally by American banker and philanthropist David Rockefeller, an internationalist who sought to address the challenges posed by the growing economic and political interdependence between the U.S. and its allies in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. The leadership of the organization has since focused on returning to \"our roots as a group of countries sharing common values and a commitment to the rule of law, open economies and societies, and democratic principles\". \nThe Trilateral Commission is headed by an executive committee and three regional chairs representing Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, with headquarters in Paris, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo, respectively. Meetings are held annually at locations that rotate among the three regions; regional and national meetings are held throughout the year. Most gatherings focus on discussing reports and debating strategy to meet the commission's aims.\nThe Trilateral Commission represents influential commercial and political interests. As of 2021, there were roughly 400 members, including leading figures in politics, business, media, and academia. Each country within the three regions is assigned a quota of members reflecting its relative political and economic strength.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nThe Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, North American nations (the U.S. and Canada), and Western European nations to foster substantive political and economic dialogue across the world. The idea of the commission was developed in the early 1970s, a time of considerable discord among the United States and its allies in Western Europe, Japan, and Canada.\nTo quote its founding declaration:\n\n\"Growing interdependence is a fact of life of the contemporary world. It transcends and influences national systems... While it is important to develop greater cooperation among all the countries of the world, Japan, Western Europe, and North America, in view of their great weight in the world economy and their massive relations with one another, bear a special responsibility for developing effective cooperation, both in their own interests and in those of the rest of the world.\"\n\"To be effective in meeting common problems, Japan, Western Europe, and North America will have to consult and cooperate more closely, on the basis of equality, to develop and carry out coordinated policies on matters affecting their common interests... refrain from unilateral actions incompatible with their interdependence and from actions detrimental to other regions... [and] take advantage of existing international and regional organizations and further enhance their role.\"\n\"The Commission hopes to play a creative role as a channel of free exchange of opinions with other countries and regions. Further progress of the developing countries and greater improvement of East-West relations will be a major concern.\"\nZbigniew Brzezinski, a Rockefeller advisor who was a specialist on international affairs (and later President Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981), left Columbia University to organize the group, along with:\n\nEdwin Reischauer, professor at Harvard University and United States Ambassador to Japan, 1961–1966\nGeorge S. Franklin, executive director of the Council on Foreign Relations 1953–1971\nGerard C. Smith, SALT I negotiator and its first North American chairman\nHenry D. Owen, foreign policy studies director at the Brookings Institution\nMax Kohnstamm, European Policy Centre\nRobert R. Bowie, the Foreign Policy Association and director of the Harvard Center for International Affairs\nMarshall Hornblower, former partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering\nTadashi Yamamoto, Japan Center for International Exchange\nWilliam Scranton, former governor of Pennsylvania. \nOther founding members included Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, both later heads of the Federal Reserve System. \nThe organization's records are stored at the Rockefeller Archive Center in North Tarrytown, NY.\n\n\n== Meetings ==\nThe Trilateral Commission initiated its biannual meetings in October 1973 in Tokyo, Japan. In May 1976 the first plenary meeting of all of the commission's regional groups took place in Kyoto, Japan. Since the ninth meeting in 1978, plenary meetings have taken place annually. Besides annual plenary meetings, regional meetings have also taken place in each of the Asia Pacific Group, the European Group and the North American Group. Since its founding, the discussion group has produced an official journal, Trialogue.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\nMembership is divided into numbers proportionate to each of the think tank's three regional areas. North America is represented by 120 members: 20 Canadian, 13 Mexican and 87 American. The European group has reached its limit of 170 members from almost every country on the continent; the ceilings for individual countries are 20 for Germany, 18 for France, Italy and the United Kingdom, 12 for Spain and 1–6 for the rest. At first Asia and Oceania were represented only by Japan, but in 2000 the Japanese group of 85 members became the Pacific Asia group, comprising 117 members: 75 Japanese, 11 South Koreans, seven Australian and New Zealand citizens, and 15 members from the ASEAN nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). The Pacific Asia group also included 9 members from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The commission now claims \"more than 100\" Pacific Asian members.\nThe Trilateral Commission's bylaws apparently deny membership to public officials. It draws its members from politics, business, and academia, and has three chairpersons, one from each region. The current chairs are former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Joseph S. Nye, Jr., former head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet, and Yasuchika Hasegawa, chair of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\nAs of September 2021\n\n\n=== Notable members ===\nGraham Allison, Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School\nAlyssa Ayres, Dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University\nCatherine Bertini, Professor, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs\nAntony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State 2021–2025, son of Donald Mayer Blinken, stepson of Samuel Pisar\nMichael R.

He has cited it as one of the most interesting and insightful books showing the modern democratic system not to really be a democracy at all, but controlled by elites who seek to keep the general public disengaged from genuine democratic participation by subtle and mostly non-violent methods and to redefine democracy itself in operative terms that enshrine their own interests as a tiny privileged minority. Chomsky adds that as it was an internal discussion, they felt free to \"let their hair down\" and to talk openly about the need for an increasingly active and defiant public to be reduced back to its proper state of apathy and obedience lest it continue to use democratic means to deprive them of their power.\nCritics accuse the Commission of promoting a global consensus among the international ruling classes in order to manage international affairs in the interest of the financial and industrial elites under the Trilateral umbrella.\nIn his 1980 book With No Apologies, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater suggested that the discussion group was \"a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power: political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical... [in] the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.\"\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories involving the Trilateral Commission ==\nSome conspiracy theorists believe the organization to be a central plotter of a world government or synarchy. In his book Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground, Jonathan Kay wrote that Luke Rudkowski interrupted a lecture by former Trilateral Commission director Zbigniew Brzezinski in April 2007 and accused the organization and a few others of having orchestrated the 9/11 attacks to initiate a new world order.\nEconomist Anthony C. Sutton was critical of the Trilateral Commission's goals and methods, but also said the group could not be characterized as conspiratorial, but his criterion for a conspiracy is that membership be secretive and highly policed. He wrote: \"The Trilateral Commission is not a conspiracy. Its membership list is completely public - it costs a postage stamp to get one.” However, in the same text he clarifies what is problematic about the Commission, arguing that it amounts to “a forum for discussion, a place where ideas can be kicked around, 'a rich man's club,' as someone commented, where people can be assessed, where discrete comment and criticism can be made away from a nosy press and a possibly unsympathetic public.\"  \nNeo-conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer mockingly alluded to the conspiracy theories about the commission when he was asked in 2012 who makes up the \"Republican establishment\", saying, \"Karl Rove is the president. We meet every month on the full moon... [at] the Masonic Temple. We have the ritual: Karl brings the incense, I bring the live lamb and the long knife, and we began... with a pledge of allegiance to the Trilateral Commission.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\nBooks\n\nCrozier, Michel; Huntington, Samuel; Watanuki, Joji (1975).

        "title": "Project Azorian",
        "wikipedia_content": "Project Azorian (also called \"Jennifer\" by the press after its Top Secret Security Compartment) was a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129 from the Pacific Ocean floor in 1974 using the purpose-built ship Hughes Glomar Explorer.  The 1968 sinking of K-129 occurred about 1,560 miles (2,510 km) northwest of Hawaii.  Project Azorian was one of the most complex, expensive, and covert intelligence operations of the Cold War at a cost of about $800 million, or $5.1 billion today.\nThe US designed the recovery ship and its lifting cradle using concepts developed with Global Marine (see Project Mohole) that used their precision stability equipment to keep the ship nearly stationary above the target while lowering nearly three miles (4.8 km) of pipe.  They worked with scientists to develop methods for preserving paper that had been underwater for years in hopes of being able to recover and read the submarine's codebooks. The reasons that this project was undertaken included the recovery of an intact R-21 nuclear missile and cryptological documents and equipment.\nThe Soviet Union was unable to locate K-129, but the US determined its general location from data recorded by four Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) sites and the Adak Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) array. The US identified an acoustic event on March 8 that likely originated from an explosion aboard the submarine, and was able to determine the location to within five nautical miles (5.8 mi; 9.3 km).\nThe submarine USS Halibut located the boat using the Fish, a towed, 12-foot (3.7 m), two-short-ton (1.8 t) collection of cameras, strobe lights, and sonar that was built to withstand extreme depths. The recovery operation in international waters about six years later used mining for manganese nodules as its cover story. \nThe mining company and ship were nominally owned by reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, but secretly backed by the CIA, who paid for the construction of the Hughes Glomar Explorer. The ship recovered a portion of K-129, but a mechanical failure in the grapple caused two-thirds of the recovered section to break off during recovery.\n\n\n== The wreck of K-129 ==\n\nOn February 24, 1968, K-129, a Soviet Project 629A ballistic missile submarine attached to the 15th Submarine Squadron of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, left Rybachiy Naval Base in Kamchatka on a routine missile patrol, the boat's third since completing a major modernization the previous year. On the first day, the sub cruised out to deep water, conducted a test dive, surfaced to radio in, and embarked for its patrol station. The sub was to make standard radio contact with its commanders in Kamchatka when crossing the 180th meridian and when arriving on station. But K-129 missed its designated check-ins and did not respond to communication attempts. By the third week of March, the submarine was declared missing.\nIn April 1968, many Soviet Pacific Fleet surface and air assets deployed to the North Pacific Ocean, performing unusual search operations. The activity was evaluated by the United States Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) as a possible reaction to the loss of a Soviet submarine. Soviet surface ship searches were centered on a location known to be associated with Soviet Golf II-class strategic ballistic missile (SSB) diesel submarine patrol routes. These submarines carried three nuclear missiles in an extended sail/conning tower, and routinely deployed within missile range of the US west coast. After weeks of searching, the Soviets were unable to locate the sunken boat, and Soviet Pacific Fleet operations gradually returned to normal.\nThe US Navy analyzed acoustic data recorded by the SOSUS hydrophone network in the northern Pacific—four AFTAC sites and the Adak, Alaska SOSUS array—and found evidence of the implosion that had sunk the Russian sub. Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Point Sur, south of Monterey, California, isolated a sonic signature on its low-frequency array recordings of an implosion that had occurred on March 8, 1968. Using NavFac Point Sur's date and time of the event, NavFac Adak and the US West Coast NAVFAC were also able to isolate the acoustic event. With five SOSUS lines-of-bearing, Naval Intelligence was able to localize the site of the K-129 wreck to the vicinity of 40.1° N latitude and 179.9° E longitude (close to the International Date Line).\n\nIn July 1968, the United States Navy began \"Operation Sand Dollar\" with the deployment of USS Halibut from Pearl Harbor to the wreck site. Sand Dollar's objective was to find and photograph K-129. In 1968 Halibut, which had been configured to use deep submergence search equipment, was the US Navy's only such specially-equipped submarine. Halibut located the wreck after three weeks of visual search using robotic remote-controlled cameras. (It took almost five months of search to find the wreck of the US nuclear-powered submarine Scorpion in the Atlantic, also in 1968). Halibut is reported to have spent the next several weeks taking more than 20,000 closeup photos of every aspect of the K-129 wreck, a feat for which Halibut received a special classified Presidential Unit Citation signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.\nThe photos were sent to the National Photographic Interpretation Center at the CIA to determine what, if anything, could be determined about the status of the wreck. CIA analysts wrote a report indicating that there was a good probability that the nuclear missile in the #3 missile tube was still intact.\nIn 1970, based upon this photography, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and Henry Kissinger, then National Security Advisor, proposed a clandestine plan to recover the wreckage so that the US could study Soviet nuclear missile technology, as well as possibly recover cryptographic materials. The proposal was accepted by President Richard Nixon, and the CIA was tasked to attempt the recovery.\n\n\n== Building Glomar Explorer and its cover story ==\n\nGlobal Marine Development Inc., the research and development arm of Global Marine Inc., a pioneer in deepwater offshore drilling operations, was contracted to design, build and operate Hughes Glomar Explorer to secretly salvage the sunken Soviet submarine. The ship was built at the Sun Shipbuilding yard near Philadelphia. Billionaire businessman Howard Hughes – whose companies were already contractors on numerous classified US military weapons, aircraft and satellite contracts – agreed to lend his name to the project to support the cover story that the ship was mining manganese nodules from the ocean floor, but Hughes and his companies had no actual involvement in the project. K-129 was photographed at a depth of over 16,000 feet (4,900 m), and thus the salvage operation would be well beyond the depth of any ship salvage operation ever attempted. On November 1, 1972, work began on the 63,000-short-ton (57,000 t), 619-foot-long (189 m) Hughes Glomar Explorer (HGE).\nAt least two preparatory missions were carried out in the general area of the recovery site using other ships. From September 1970 to January 1971, the drilling ship GLOMAR II collected site data as part of Project AXMINSTER. From January to July 1972, the R.V. SEASCOPE surveyed the general area to within 45 nm of the recovery site. Both missions also probed the Soviet reactions to research ships in the region.\nThe primary objective was to recover a major portion of the submarine. In particular, the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) expected to recover cryptographic equipment, a nuclear warhead, a SS-N-5 missile, the navigation system, fire control system, sonar system, ASW countermeasures, and related documentation.\n\n\n== Recovery ==\nHughes Glomar Explorer employed a large mechanical claw, which Lockheed officially titled the \"Capture Vehicle\" but affectionately called Clementine. The capture vehicle was designed to be lowered to the ocean floor, grasp the targeted submarine section, and then lift that section into the ship's moon pool for processing. One requirement of this technology was to keep the floating base stable and in position over a fixed point 16,000 feet (4,900 m) below the ocean surface.\nThe capture vehicle was lowered and raised on a pipe string similar to those used on oil drilling rigs. Section by section,  pairs of 30-foot (9.1 m) steel pipes were strung together to lower the claw through a hole in the middle of the ship.  This configuration was designed by Western Gear Corp. of Everett, Washington.  Upon a successful capture by the claw, the lift reversed the process: 60-foot (18 m) pairs drawn up and removed one at a time. The salvaged \"Target Object\" was thus to be drawn into the moon pool in the center of the vessel, the doors of which could then be closed to form a floor for the salvaged section. This allowed for the entire salvage process to take place underwater, away from the view of other ships, aircraft, or spy satellites.\nHughes Glomar Explorer arrived at the recovery site (40.1°N 179.9°E﻿ / 40.1; 179.9) on July 4, 1974, after departing from Long Beach, California, on June 20, and sailing 3,008 nautical miles (5,571 km). The ship conducted salvage operations for over a month. During this period, at least two Soviet Navy ships visited Hughes Glomar Explorer's work site, the oceangoing tugboat SB-10, and the Soviet missile range instrumentation ship Chazma. It was found out after 1991 that the Soviets were tipped off about the operation and were aware that the CIA was planning some kind of salvage operation, but the military command believed it impossible that they could perform such a task and disregarded further intelligence warnings. Later, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin started sending urgent messages back to the Soviet Navy warning that an operation was imminent. Soviet military engineering experts reevaluated their positions and claimed that it was indeed possible (though highly unlikely) to recover K-129, and ships in the area were ordered to report any unusual activity, although the lack of knowledge as to where K-129 was located impeded their ability to stop any salvage operation.\nUS Army Major General Roland Lajoie stated that, according to a briefing he received by the CIA during recovery operations, Clementine suffered a catastrophic failure, causing two-thirds of the already raised portion of K-129 to sink back to the ocean floor. Former Lockheed and Hughes Global Marine employees who worked on the operation have stated that several of the \"claws\" intended to grab the submarine fractured, possibly because they were manufactured from maraging steel, which is very strong, but not very ductile compared with other kinds of steel. Video evidence and eyewitness reports have stated that multiple claws of Clementine sheared off, causing  a 100-foot (30 m) section of the submarine to fall back to the seafloor. Eyewitnesses have stated that only the 38-foot (12 m) bow section was raised, while the sail portion containing the nuclear missiles was lost during the raising operation.\n\nThe recovered section included two nuclear torpedoes, and thus Project Azorian was not a complete failure. The bodies of six crewmen were also recovered, and were given a memorial service and with military honors, buried at sea in a metal casket because of radioactivity concerns. Other crew members have reported that code books and other materials of apparent interest to CIA employees aboard the vessel were recovered, and images of inventory printouts exhibited in the documentary suggest that various submarine components, such as hatch covers, instruments and sonar equipment were also recovered. White's documentary also states that the ship's bell from K-129 was recovered, and was subsequently returned to the Soviet Union as part of a diplomatic effort. The CIA considered the project one of the greatest intelligence coups of the Cold War.\nThe entire salvage operation was recorded by a CIA documentary film crew, but this film remains classified. A short portion of the film, showing the recovery and subsequent burial at sea of the six bodies recovered in the forward section of K-129, was given to the Russian government in 1992.\n\n\n== Public disclosure ==\n\n\n=== The New York Times story ===\nTime Magazine credited Jack Anderson as breaking the story in a March 1975 radio broadcast. Rejecting a plea from the Director of Central Intelligence William Colby to suppress the story, Anderson said he released the story because \"Navy experts have told us that the sunken sub contains no real secrets and that the project, therefore, is a waste of the taxpayers' money.\"\nIn February 1975, investigative reporter and former New York Times writer Seymour Hersh had planned to publish a story on Project Azorian. Bill Kovach, the New York Times Washington bureau chief at the time, said in 2005 that the government offered a convincing argument to delay publication – exposure at that time, while the project was ongoing, \"would have caused an international incident.\" The New York Times published its account in March 1975, after a story appeared in the Los Angeles Times, and included a five-paragraph explanation of the many twists and turns in the path to publication. CIA director George H. W. Bush reported on several occasions to U.S. president Gerald Ford on media reports and the future use of the ship. The CIA concluded that it seemed unclear what, if any, action was taken by the Soviet Union after learning of the story.\n\n\n=== FOIA request and the Glomar response ===\nAfter stories had been published about the CIA's attempts to stop publication of information about Project Azorian, Harriet Ann Phillippi, a journalist, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the CIA for any records about the CIA's attempts.  The CIA refused to either confirm or deny the existence of such documents.  This type of non-responsive reply has since come to be known as the \"Glomar response\" or \"Glomarization\".\n\n\n=== 1998 release of video ===\nA video showing the 1974 memorial services for the six Soviet seamen whose bodies were recovered by Project Azorian was forwarded by the U.S. to Russia in the early 1990s. Portions of this video were shown on television documentaries concerning Project Azorian, including a 1998 Discovery Channel special called A Matter of National Security (based on Clyde W. Burleson's book, The Jennifer Project (1977)) and again in 1999, on a PBS Cold War submarine episode of NOVA.\n\n\n=== 2010 release of 1985 CIA article ===\nIn February 2010, the CIA released an article from the fall 1985 edition of the CIA internal journal Studies in Intelligence following an application by researcher Matthew Aid at the National Security Archive to declassify the information under the Freedom of Information Act. Exactly what the operation managed to salvage remained unclear. The report was written by an unidentified participant in Project Azorian.\n\n\n=== 2010 release of President Ford cabinet meeting ===\nPresident Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger, Philip Buchen (Counsel to the President), John O. Marsh, Jr. (Counselor to the President), Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld, USAF Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft (Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs), and William Colby (Director of Central Intelligence) discussed the leak and whether the Ford administration would react to Hersh's story in a cabinet meeting on March 19, 1975, the same day that The New York Times published the story. Secretary of Defense Schlesinger is quoted as saying,\n\nThis episode has been a major American accomplishment. The operation is a marvel – technically, and with maintaining secrecy.\nSchlesinger indicated at least some form of success that should be confirmed publicly. CIA Director William Colby dissented, recalling the U-2 crisis, saying:\n\nI think we should not put the Soviet Union under such pressure to respond.\nThe Los Angeles Times published a four-page story the next day by Jack Nelson with the headline \"Administration Won't Talk About Sub Raised by CIA.\"\n\n\n== Conspiracy theory ==\nTime magazine and a court filing by Felice D. Cohen and Morton H. Halperin on behalf of the Military Audit Project  suggest that the alleged project goal of raising a Soviet submarine might itself have been a cover story for another secret mission. Tapping undersea communication cables, the cover up of an assassination, the discovery of Atlantis, the installation of a missile silo, and installation and repair of surveillance systems to monitor ship and submarine movements are listed as possibilities for the actual purpose of such a secret mission.\n\n\n== Eyewitness accounts ==\nW. Craig Reed told an inside account of Project Azorian in his book Red November: Inside the Secret U.S. – Soviet Submarine War (2010). The account was provided by Joe Houston, the senior engineer who designed leading-edge camera systems used by the Hughes Glomar Explorer team to photograph K-129 on the ocean floor. The team needed pictures that offered precise measurements to design the grappling arm and other systems used to bring the sunken submarine up from the bottom. Houston worked for the mysterious \"Mr. P\" (John Parangosky) who worked for CIA Deputy Director Carl E. Duckett, the two leaders of Project Azorian. Duckett later worked with Houston at another company, and intimated that the CIA may have recovered much more from the K-129 than admitted publicly. Reed also details how the deep submergence towed sonar array technology was used for subsequent Operation Ivy Bells missions to wiretap underwater Soviet communications cables.\nThe documentary film Azorian: The Raising Of The K-129 features interviews with Sherman Wetmore, Global Marine heavy lift operations manager; Charlie Johnson, Global Marine heavy lift engineer; and Raymond Feldman, Lockheed Ocean Systems senior staff engineer. They were the three principals in the design of the Hughes Glomar Explorer heavy lift system and the Lockheed capture vehicle (CV or claw). They were also on board the ship during the mission and were intimately involved with the recovery operation. They confirmed that only 38 ft (12 m) of the bow was eventually recovered. The intent was to recover the forward two thirds (138 ft [42 m]) of K-129, which had broken off from the rear section of the submarine and was designated the Target Object (TO). The capture vehicle successfully lifted the TO from the ocean floor, but a failure of part of the capture vehicle on the way up caused the loss of 100 ft (30 m) of the TO, including the sail. Norman Polmar and Michael White published Project Azorian: The CIA And The Raising of the K-129 in 2010. The book contains additional documentary evidence about the effort to locate the submarine and the recovery operation.\n\n\n== CIA Museum artifacts ==\nA number of artifacts from Project Azorian and Glomar Explorer are on display at the CIA Museum. The museum has shared declassified images and video featuring the artifacts through its website; however the physical grounds of the museum are on the compound of the George Bush Center for Intelligence and thus physically inaccessible to the public.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Documentaries ==\nThe documentary film Azorian: The Raising Of The K-129 was produced by Michael White and released in 2009.\nSpy Ops: Project Azorian (Season 1, Episode 8) is a short documentary also produced by Michael White which adds some details to his earlier work.

        "title": "The Nine Unknown",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Nine Unknown is a 1923  novel by Talbot Mundy. Originally serialised in Adventure\nmagazine, it concerns the Nine Unknown Men, a secret society founded to preserve and develop knowledge that would be dangerous to humanity if it fell into the wrong hands. The nine unknown men were entrusted with guarding nine books of secret knowledge.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the novel the nine men are the embodiment of good and face up against evil worshiper who sow confusion and masquerade as the true sages. The story surrounds a priest called Father Cyprian who is seeking possession of the books but who wants to destroy them out of Christian piety, and a number of other characters who are interested in learning their contents.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThe concept of the \"Nine Unknown Men\" was further popularized by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in their 1960 book The Morning of the Magicians. They claimed that the Nine Unknown were real and had been founded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka around 270 BC. They also claimed that Pope Silvester II had met the Nine Unknown, and that nineteenth-century French colonial administrator and writer Louis Jacolliot insisted on their existence.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the first edition of Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible (1969), The Nine Unknown were the final dedicatees mentioned in the dedication.\nThe \"Nine Unknown\" have since been the subject of the several novels including Shadow Tyrants by Clive Cussler and Boyd Morrison; The Mahabharata Secret, a 2013 novel by Christopher C. Doyle; Finders, Keepers, a 2015 novel by Sapan Saxena; and Shobha Nihalani's Nine novel trilogy.\nThe American television series Heroes prominently features the number nine, and the writers and producers Aron Coliete and Joe Pakaski have credited the story of Ashoka and The Nine Unknown Men as one of the many influences for the series and as a clue to the mystery surrounding the number.\nJL50 is a Hindi-language sci-fi web series launched in September 2020 on Sony Liv. The series centers around the Nine Unknown and the books they preserved. It relates that these books contain knowledge of political power, the origin of martial arts, communication with extraterrestrial species, and time travel. The series mentions Project A (for Ashoka) which involves time travel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAscended master\nEight Immortals\nIlluminati\nNavaratnas\nSeven Brahmarshi\nVaimanika Shastra\nEmperor Ashoka\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTaves, Brian (2006).

        "title": "Morgellons",
        "wikipedia_content": "Morgellons () is the informal name of a self-diagnosed, scientifically unsubstantiated skin condition in which individuals have sores that they believe contain fibrous material. Morgellons is not well understood, but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis, on the psychiatric spectrum. The sores are typically the result of compulsive scratching, and the fibers, when analysed, are consistently found to have originated from cotton and other textiles.\nThe condition was named in 2002 by Mary Leitao, a mother who rejected the medical diagnosis of her son's delusional parasitosis. She chose the name from a letter written by a mid-17th-century physician. Leitao and others involved in her Morgellons Research Foundation successfully lobbied members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the condition in 2006. CDC researchers issued the results of their multi-year study in January 2012, indicating that no disease organisms were present in the samples from the individuals examined and that the fibers found were likely cotton. The researchers concluded that the condition was \"similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation\".\n\n\n== Medical description ==\nMorgellons is poorly understood but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis in which individuals have some form of skin condition with sores that they believe contain fibers. Its presentation is very similar to delusional parasitosis, with the addition that people with the condition believe there are inanimate objects in their skin lesions. An active online community supports the notion that it is an infectious disease, disputes that it is psychological, and proposes an association with Lyme disease.  Controversy has resulted; publications \"largely from a single group of investigators\" describe findings of spirochetes, keratin and collagen in skin samples in small numbers of patients; these findings are contradicted by much larger studies conducted by the CDC, which found skin samples mostly contained cellulose that came from cotton, with no evidence of infection or other causes.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Mary Leitao ===\nIn 2001, according to Leitao, her then-two-year-old son developed sores under his lip and began to complain of bugs. Leitao says she examined the sores with her son's toy microscope and discovered red, blue, black, and white fibers. She states that she took her son to see at least eight different doctors who were unable to find any disease, allergy, or anything unusual about her son's described symptoms. Fred Heldrich, a Johns Hopkins pediatrician with a reputation \"for solving mystery cases\", examined Leitao's son. Heldrich found nothing abnormal about the boy's skin, and wrote to the referring physician that \"Leitao would benefit from a psychiatric evaluation and support\", and registered his worry about Leitao's \"use\" of her son. Leitao last consulted an unnamed Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist who refused to see her son after reviewing his records, and suggested Leitao herself might have \"Munchausen's by proxy, a psychiatric syndrome in which a parent pretends a child is sick or makes him sick to get attention from the medical system\". According to Leitao, several medical professionals she sought out shared this opinion of a potential psychological disorder:\n\n[Leitao] said she long ago grew accustomed to being doubted by doctors whenever she sought help for her son, who is now seven and still suffering from recurring lesions. \"They suggested that maybe I was neurotic,\" Leitao said. \"They said they were not interested in seeing him because I had Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.\"\nLeitao says that her son developed more sores, and more fibers continued to poke out of them. She and her husband, Edward Leitao, an internist, felt their son had \"something unknown\". \n\n\n=== Morgellons named ===\nLeitao chose the name Morgellons disease (with a hard g) from a description of an illness in the medical case-history essay, A Letter to a Friend (c. 1656, pub. 1690) by Sir Thomas Browne, where the physician describes several medical conditions in his experience, including \"that endemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs\".\n\n\n=== Morgellons Research Foundation ===\nLeitao started the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) informally in 2002 and as an official non-profit in 2004. The MRF website states that its purpose is to raise awareness and funding for research into the proposed condition, described by the organization as a \"poorly understood illness, which can be disfiguring and disabling\". Leitao stated that she initially hoped to receive information from scientists or physicians who might understand the problem, but instead, thousands of others contacted her describing their sores and fibers, as well as neurological symptoms, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and other symptoms.  The MRF claimed to have received self-identified reports of Morgellons from all 50 U.S. states and 15 other countries, including Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands. It also claimed that it had been contacted by over 12,000 families.\nIn 2012, the Morgellons Research Foundation closed down and directed future inquiries to the Oklahoma State University.\n\n\n=== Media coverage ===\nIn May 2006, a CBS news segment on Morgellons aired in Southern California. The same day, the Los Angeles County Department of Health services issued a statement saying, \"No credible medical or public health association has verified the existence or diagnosis of 'Morgellons Disease'\", and \"at this time there is no reason for individuals to panic over unsubstantiated reports of this disease\". In June and July 2006, there were segments on CNN, ABC's Good Morning America, and NBC's The Today Show. In August 2006, a segment of the ABC show Medical Mysteries was devoted to the subject. Morgellons was featured on ABC's Nightline on January 16, 2008, and as the cover story of the January 20, 2008, issue of The Washington Post.\nThe first article to propose Morgellons as a new disease in a scientific journal was a review article co-authored by members of the MRF and published in 2006 by the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology. A 2006 article in the San Francisco Chronicle reported, \"There have been no clinical studies\" of Morgellons disease. A New Scientist article in 2007 also covered the phenomenon, noting that people are reporting similar symptoms in Europe and Australia.\nIn an article published in the Los Angeles Times on April 22, 2010, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell claimed to have the condition.\nOn June 13, 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National broadcast The Mystery of Morgellons with guests including Mayo Clinic Professor Mark Davis.\n\n\n=== CDC investigation ===\nThe Morgellons Research Foundation coordinated a mailing campaign via their website, in which thousands of people sent form letters to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) task force, which first met in June 2006. By August 2006, the task force consisted of 12 people, including two pathologists, a toxicologist, an ethicist, a mental health expert, and specialists in infectious, parasitic, environmental and chronic diseases.\nIn June 2007, the CDC started a website relating to Morgellons, CDC Study of an Unexplained Dermopathy, and by November 2007, the CDC opened an investigation into the condition. Kaiser Permanente, a health-care consortium in Northern California, was chosen to assist with the investigation, which involved skin biopsies from affected people and characterization of foreign material such as fibers or threads obtained from people to determine their potential source. The U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the American Academy of Dermatology assisted with pathology. In January 2012, the CDC released the results of the study.\nThe CDC concluded that 59% of subjects showed cognitive deficits and 63% had evidence of clinically significant symptoms. They stated that 50% of the individuals had drugs in their systems, and 78% reported exposure to solvents (potential skin irritants). The study detected no parasites or mycobacteria in the samples collected from any individuals. Most materials collected from participants' skin were composed of cellulose, likely of cotton origin.\n\n\n=== Internet and media influence ===\nAn active online community and publications \"largely from a single group of investigators\" have supported the notion that Morgellons is an infectious disease, and propose an association with Lyme disease; these findings are contradicted by the much larger studies conducted by the CDC. People usually self-diagnose Morgellons based on information from the internet and find support and confirmation in online communities of people with similar illness beliefs. In 2006, Waddell and Burke reported the influence of the internet on people self-diagnosed with Morgellons: \"physicians are becoming more and more challenged by the many persons who attempt self-diagnosis on-line. In many cases, these attempts are well-intentioned, yet wrong, and a person's belief in some of these oftentimes unscientific sites online may preclude their trust in the evidence-based approaches and treatment recommendations of their physician.\"\nPhysician Fidel Vila-Rodriguez wrote in a 2008 editorial that the Internet promotes the spreading and supporting of \"bizarre\" disease beliefs because in online communities, \"a belief is not considered delusional if it is accepted by other members of an individual's culture or subculture\". Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the \"World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet.\" According to this hypothesis, people with delusions of parasitosis and other psychological disorders become convinced they have \"Morgellons\" after reading internet accounts of others with similar symptoms. This phenomenon is known as mass psychogenic illness, where physical symptoms without an organic cause spread to multiple people within the same community or social group. The Dallas Observer writes that Morgellons may be memetically spread via the internet and mass media, and \"[i]f this is the case, then Morgellons is one in a long line of weird diseases that have swept through populations, only to disappear without a trace once public concern subsides\". The article draws parallels to several media-spread mass delusions.\nDermatologist Caroline Koblenzer specifically faults the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website for misleading people: \"Clearly, as more and more of our patients discover this site (MRF), there will be an ever greater waste of valuable time and resources on fruitless research into fibers, fluffs, irrelevant bacteria, and innocuous worms and insects.\" A 2005 Popular Mechanics article stated that Morgellons symptoms are well known and characterized in the context of other disorders, and that \"widespread reports of the strange fibers date back\" only a few years to when the MRF first described them on the Internet. The Los Angeles Times, in an article on Morgellons, notes that \"[t]he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother\".\nIn 2008, The Washington Post reported that internet discussions about Morgellons include many conspiracy theories about the cause, including biological warfare, nanotechnology, chemtrails and extraterrestrial life. The Atlantic says it \"even received pop-culture attention\" when it was featured on Criminal Minds, adding that \"Morgellons patients have further alienated themselves from the mainstream medical community\" by \"linking Morgellons to another illness viewed skeptically by most doctors, chronic Lyme disease, and by attacking those who doubt their condition\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture-bound syndrome\nFormication\nFringe medicine\nJay Traver\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nMass psychogenic illness\nMatchbox sign\nMedicalization\nMünchausen syndrome\nQuaternary prevention\nSomatic symptom disorder\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFair, Brian (2010). \"Morgellons: Contested illness, diagnostic compromise and medicalisation\".

        "title": "Industry plant",
        "wikipedia_content": "Industry plant is a pejorative used to describe musicians who become popular through nepotism, inheritance, wealth, or their connections in the music industry rather than on their own merits. Artists described as industry plants often present themselves as independent and self-made, but are alleged to have their public images manufactured for them by record labels. \nThe term originated in the early 2010s on hip hop-focused message boards to describe various rappers before being used against indie rock and pop musicians, such as Clairo and Billie Eilish in the late 2010s. It has been called a conspiracy theory by critics and criticized in the media by artists for being disproportionately used against female artists and for placing scrutiny on individual musicians rather than the music industry as a whole.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe term \"industry plant\" commonly refers to musicians who quickly find success, regardless of skill or merit, and describe themselves as self-made and independent despite being heavily supported by a record label or having other resources and connections to the music industry that they intentionally hide, while also being more focused on business than on artistic expression. It is typically used as a pejorative by music fans, largely of Generation Z, against artists who they believe to be undeserving of their fame or success. \nArtists who are called industry plants are sometimes alleged to have had their personas manufactured by marketing executives before being marketed to the public. It has been compared to the idea of \"selling out\". \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe term \"industry plant\" is believed to have originated on hip hop message boards in the early 2010s, gaining popularity after being used in a thread on the discussion forum KanyeToThe in 2012, in which rappers such as Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, and Waka Flocka Flame were alleged by users to be industry plants. American singer Lana Del Rey has retrospectively been described as an early example of industry plant accusations. Upon the release of her debut studio album Born to Die (2012), her wealthy parents and her previous musical career as Lizzy Grant led to questions about her authenticity as an artist. \nAfter American rapper Raury released his mixtape, Indigo Child, in 2014, was quickly signed to Columbia Records, and received coverage from Billboard for the music video for his song \"God's Whisper\", he was frequently called an industry plant online in 2015. He appeared on the cover of XXL for their annual Freshman Class list of up-and-coming artists in 2015, where he wore a shirt reading \"industry plant\" in response to the accusations. Christina Lee of Vice wrote in 2015 that \"recent talk of Raury being an industry plant\" was \"silly\" but \"makes some sense\", while Chris Thomas of Out called Raury \"a popular target of industry plant conspiracy theorists\" in 2017. Chance the Rapper faced similar accusations of being an industry plant on music forums by 2015 due to his sudden success after independently releasing several mixtapes.\nThe term \"industry plant\" later became popular among indie rock fans. The increase in industry plant rumors in the late 2010s has been attributed by critics to the rise of music streaming. Clairo, who quickly rose to fame after her song \"Pretty Girl\" went viral online in 2017, was described by Leor Galil of the Chicago Reader as \"a magnet for 'industry plant' insults\" since 2017, when Reddit threads about her father working as the chief marketing officer of Converse and co-founding its Rubber Tracks recording studio before she became popular led to accusations of her being an industry plant. Other users alleged that her \"homespun\" image was also created by her father and his associates, and the usage of the term to describe her led to the term gaining more widespread usage.\n\nAfter gaining fame from her song \"Bury a Friend\" in 2018, American singer Billie Eilish was frequently called an industry plant online on YouTube and Reddit, where users similarly made threads about her personality being manufactured. Puerto Rican rapper Iann Dior named his debut studio album, Industry Plant (2020), after his being called an industry plant due to his quick rise to fame. Also in 2020, American singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers responded to accusations that she was an industry plant, including a music critic who tweeted that they were \"on team 'Phoebe Bridgers is an industry plant'\", by stating that the Strokes and \"every white boy who is mediocre\" were industry plants as well and calling it \"such an insane fucking double standard\".\nThe American pop punk band Tramp Stamps were widely criticized by social media users as industry plants in April 2021, particularly on TikTok, due to their previous solo careers as pop singers and how their image had changed and become \"calculated\" and \"polished\" upon starting the band. Reddit users also found that the band's guitarist, Caroline Baker, was signed to record producer Dr. Luke's publishing house Prescription Songs, which furthered the accusations. In response, Rebecca Jennings of Vox wrote that \"being an 'industry plant' is about the worst thing you can be accused of on TikTok\". \nIn June 2021, American singer H.E.R. responded to claims that she was an industry plant on Instagram. Following the international success of American singer Olivia Rodrigo's debut single \"Drivers License\" in 2021, music journalists and critics debated on whether or not she was an industry plant. Podcaster DJ Akademiks has frequently discussed the concept of industry plants, including his calling American rapper Megan Thee Stallion one in June 2021 and alleging that her success in the music industry was due to her being shot by rapper Tory Lanez the year before. \n\nThe British indie rock duo Wet Leg became frequent targets of industry plant accusations after their rise to prominence in 2021, which they described as \"just misogyny\". American singer Gayle's song \"ABCDEFU\" became internationally successful by early 2022 after initially finding success on TikTok, where she premiered the song in response to a commenter asking her to \"write a breakup song using the alphabet\". Commenters on the platform alleged that she was an industry plant upon discovering that the comment prompting the song was left by an Atlantic Records marketing manager. \nAfter the success of their debut single, \"Nothing Matters\", in April 2023, the British indie rock band the Last Dinner Party were widely accused by social media users, including on Twitter, of being industry plants due to their being signed to Island Records and opening for the Rolling Stones, among other things. The group responded to the accusations on Twitter, calling them \"just a nasty lie\". In June 2023, the indie rock band Picture Parlour released their debut single \"Norwegian Wood\" and were featured on the cover of NME, leading to users on Twitter widely accusing them of being industry plants. The band's singer, Katherine Parlour, said in response to the accusations that they \"seem[ed] like lazy journalism\" and that there was \"a predominant history of male-fronted bands ... who have happened to gain a large buzz pretty quickly\" and not \"one that has been questioned\". \nAfter his song \"Rich Men North of Richmond\" went viral and became popular among American conservatives in August 2023, American singer Oliver Anthony was suspected of being an industry plant by American progressives. Also in August 2023, the hardcore punk band Scowl were alleged by fans to be industry plants, which prompted frontwoman Kat Moss to release a statement on Twitter denying and decrying the claims. American rapper Ice Spice was accused of being an industry plant after she shot to stardom following the release of her song \"Munch (Feelin' U)\", which went viral on TikTok, in 2022. She stated in response to the accusations that she would \"let people believe whatever they want to believe\" in an interview with Variety in September 2023. On TikTok, users speculated that 4Batz, an American rapper who found success through his first three songs released independently throughout 2023—including \"Act II: Date @ 8\", the remix of which featured Drake—was an industry plant because of the rapidness of his rise to fame and his \"Spotify-core\" musical style. He called the allegations \"kind of cool\" and likened himself to \"the boogeyman\" because of them.\nIn 2024, Kyndall Cunningham of Vox attributed the increased online accusations of artists as industry plants to a rise in social media users' \"compulsive skepticism\" and their \"questioning the legitimacy of everything\" following the COVID-19 pandemic. A social media post calling American singer Chappell Roan an industry plant went viral in June 2024. She pushed back against claims that she was an industry plant because of her runaway success and the quick rise in interest in her 2023 debut studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in 2024, stating that she had been working within the music industry for ten years prior; the idea of her being an industry plant was also mocked online by fans and critics.\nThe term has also been used online and by critics to describe artists such as Greta Van Fleet, Dominic Fike, Jean Dawson, CJ, Bebe Rexha, Boy Pablo, RMR, Bella Poarch, the Kid Laroi, Skip Marley, Your Old Droog, Post Malone, 4Batz, and Lizzo.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nClaims of artists being industry plants have been described as conspiracy theories by critics. In 2023, Complex's Trace William Cowen called industry plant accusations \"among the dumbest quasi-theories some listeners like to throw around whenever a new artist breaks through\". Hazel Cills stated for NPR that industry plants \"don't really exist\" and that the term \"keeps getting thrown around by younger audiences\" because of changes in the music industry and \"a kind of skepticism when a young person sees an artist and they're not already inundated with their body of work\".\nThe term \"industry plant\" has also been criticized as meaningless or vague. Josh Terry of Vice wrote that the term had \"no adequate definition\" and that there was \"no consensus at all on what an 'industry plant' actually is\". For Clash, Robin Murray wrote that the term was \"hopelessly vague, and more a criticism of ... a general, undefinable sense of inauthenticity, than any actual intersection with the music\". For Jezebel, Cills wrote that \"the term often means nearly whatever the critic in question wants it to mean\".\nCritics have described the pejorative as being used more commonly against young women than other artists. Josh Terry of Vice wrote that it was \"disproportionately directed at non-white, non-male-identifying artists\". Kyann-Sian Williams of NME also stated that it was \"often assigned to non-white, non-male success stories\", while Far Out's Elle Palmer wrote that it \"seems to be disproportionately thrown at successful young women starting out in the industry, and often with very little research to back up the damaging label\" and was \"an easy way to dismiss the talent of young women\". Under the Radar's Andy Von Pip also wrote that the term was \"a crass and often deeply misogynistic attempt to undermine [the] credibility and creativity\" of female artists.\nNick Ruskell of The Daily Telegraph wrote that the music industry was \"far more to blame\" for artists with less connections not finding success \"than individual artists trying to play the game\". Cills wrote that the term \"emphasiz[ed] a narrative that suggests popular artists are either authentic or totally fake, working without any outside help or label puppets, when in reality the lines are depressingly blurrier\". For Vox, Rebecca Jennings wrote that the criticism of Tramp Stamps in 2021 as industry plants became \"a complete dogpile on three individual women rather than corporatized capitalization on progressive politics\". Terry wrote that it \"blam[ed] artists for the machinations of a system beyond their control\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nNepo baby\nAstroturfing\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Electronic harassment",
        "wikipedia_content": "Electronic harassment, electromagnetic torture, or psychotronic torture is the delusional belief, held by individuals who call themselves \"targeted individuals\" (TIs), that malicious actors are transmitting sounds and thoughts into people's heads, affecting their bodies, and harassing them generally. The delusion often concerns government agents or crime rings and alleges that the \"perpetrators\" use electromagnetic radiation (such as the microwave auditory effect), radar, and surveillance techniques to carry out their goals. \nSome TIs claim to be victims of gang stalking, and many have created or joined support and advocacy groups.\nMultiple medical professionals have concluded that these experiences are hallucinations, the result of delusional disorders, or psychosis.\n\n\n== Experiences ==\nThe experiences of people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment using esoteric technology, and who call themselves \"targeted individuals\" (\"T.I.\"), vary, but experiences often include hearing voices in their heads calling them by name, often mocking them or others around them, as well as physical sensations like burning. They have also described being under physical surveillance by one or more people. Many of these people act and function otherwise normally and included among them are people who are successful in their careers and lives otherwise, and who find these experiences confusing, upsetting, and sometimes shameful, but entirely real. They use news stories, military journals, and declassified national security documents to support their allegations that governments have developed technology that can send voices into people's heads and cause them to feel things. The New York Times estimated that there are more than 10,000 people who self-identify as targeted individuals.\nPsychologist Lorraine Sheridan co-authored a study of gang-stalking in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology. According to Sheridan, \"One has to think of the T.I. phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the gang-stalking idea as an explanation of what is happening to them\". Mental health professionals say that T.I.s can experience hallucinations and their explanations of being targeted or harassed arise from delusional disorders or psychosis. Yale psychiatry professor Ralph Hoffman states that people often ascribe voices in their heads to external sources such as government harassment, God, or dead relatives, and it can be difficult to persuade these individuals that their belief in an external influence is delusional. Other experts compare these stories to accounts of alien abductions.\nPress accounts have documented individuals who apparently believed they were victims of electronic harassment, and in some cases persuaded courts to agree. In 2008, James Walbert went to court claiming that his former business associate had threatened him with \"jolts of radiation\" after a disagreement, and later claimed feeling symptoms such as electric shock sensations and hearing strange sounds in his ears. The court decided to issue an order banning \"electronic means\" to further harass Walbert.\n\n\n=== Notable crimes ===\nVarious people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have committed crimes, notably including a number of mass shootings.\nFuaed Abdo Ahmed, a 20-year-old man, held a man and two women hostage at the Tensas State Bank in St. Joseph, Louisiana on August 13, 2013, eventually killing two of the hostages and himself. A subsequent police investigation officially concluded that Ahmed had paranoid schizophrenia and was hearing voices. Ahmed had accused the family of his ex-girlfriend of implanting a \"microphone device\" of some kind in his head.\nOn September 16, 2013, Aaron Alexis fatally shot twelve people and injured three others in the Washington Navy Yard using a shotgun on which he had written \"my ELF weapon\", before being killed by responding police officers. The FBI concluded that Alexis had \"delusional beliefs\". These beliefs included that he was being \"controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves.\"\nOn November 20, 2014, Myron May shot and injured three people on the campus of Florida State University and was killed by responding police officers. Before the event, he had become increasingly anxious that he was under government surveillance and heard voices.\nGavin Eugene Long, who killed three police officers and injured three others in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 17, 2016, was a believer in numerous anti-government movements and conspiracy theories, but he was most notably a member of a group dedicated to helping people with \"remote brain experimentation, remote neural monitoring of an entire human's body.\"\nMatthew Choi, a 30-year-old South African, who claimed himself under a V2K electronic harassment and made remarks about \"being brainwashed through microwave\" since 2015, murdered a taxi driver in Hong Kong on October 12, 2021. The case arose mass attention in the city, and the police described him as \"extremely dangerous\".\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\nMind control conspiracy advocates believe they have found references to secret weapons in government programs such as \"Project Pandora,\" a DARPA research effort into biological and behavioral effects of microwave radiation commissioned after the Moscow Signal incident, when the U.S. embassy in Moscow was bombarded with microwaves by the Soviets beginning in 1953. It was discovered that the Soviets' intent was eavesdropping and electronic jamming rather than mind control. Project Pandora studied the effects of occupational radiation exposure, and the project's scientific review committee concluded that microwave radiation could not be used for mind control. Conspiracy advocates also frequently cite the 2002 Air Force Research Laboratory patent for using microwaves to send spoken words into someone's head. Although there is no evidence that mind control using microwaves exists, rumors of continued classified research fuel the worries of people who believe they are being targeted.\nIn 1987, a U.S. National Academy of Sciences report commissioned by the Army Research Institute noted psychotronics as one of the \"colorful examples\" of claims of psychic warfare that first surfaced in anecdotal descriptions, newspapers, and books during the 1980s. The report cited alleged psychotronic weapons such as a \"hyperspatial nuclear howitzer\" and beliefs that Russian psychotronic weapons were responsible for Legionnaire's disease and the sinking of the USS Thresher among claims that \"range from incredible to the outrageously incredible.\" The committee observed that although reports and stories as well as imagined potential uses for such weapons by military decision makers exist, \"nothing approaching scientific literature supports the claims of psychotronic weaponry.\"\nPsychotronic weapons were reportedly being studied by the Russian Federation during the 1990s with military analyst Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas saying in 1998 that there was a strong belief in Russia that weapons for attacking the mind of a soldier were a possibility, although no working devices were reported. In Russia, a group called \"Victims of Psychotronic Experimentation\" attempted to recover damages from the Federal Security Service during the mid-1990s for alleged infringement of their civil liberties including \"beaming rays\" at them, putting chemicals in the water, and using magnets to alter their minds. These fears may have been inspired by revelations of secret research into \"psychotronic\" psychological warfare techniques during the early 1990s, with Vladimir Lopatkin, a State Duma committee member in 1995, surmising \"something that was secret for so many years is the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories.\"\nIn 2012, Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin commented on plans to draft proposals for the development of psychotronic weapons. NBC News Science Editor Alan Boyle dismissed notions that such weapons actually existed, saying, \"there's nothing in the comments from Putin and Serdyukov to suggest that the Russians are anywhere close to having psychotronic weapons.\"\nMike Beck, a former NSA spy, believes his Parkinson's disease was caused by electronic harassment. In 2014, the NSA gave Beck's attorney Mark Zaid a statement which said the agency had received \"intelligence information from 2012 associating the hostile country to which Mr. Beck traveled in the late 1990s with a high-powered microwave system weapon\", but added that \"The National Security Agency has no evidence that such a weapon, if it existed and if it was associated with the hostile country in the late 1990s, was or was not used against Mr. Beck\". NSA general counsel Glenn Gerstell told The Washington Post that \"the agency has not found any proof that Beck or his co-worker were attacked\".\n\n\n== Support and advocacy communities ==\nThere are extensive online support networks and numerous websites maintained by people fearing mind control. Palm Springs psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of delusional disorders on many of these websites, and psychologists agree that such sites negatively reinforce mental troubles, while some say that the sharing and acceptance of a common delusion could function as a form of group cognitive therapy.\nAccording to psychologist Sheridan, the amount of content online about electronic harassment that suggests it is a fact without any debate on the subject, creates a harmful, ideological, platform for such behavior.\nAs part of a 2006 British study by Vaughan Bell, independent psychiatrists determined \"signs of psychosis are strongly present\" based on evaluation of a sample of online mind-control accounts whose posters were \"very likely to be schizophrenic.\" Psychologists have identified many examples of people reporting \"mind control experiences\" (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are \"highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs.\" Common themes include \"bad guys\" using \"psychotronics\" and \"microwaves,\" frequent mention of the CIA's MKULTRA project and frequent citing of a scientific paper entitled \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy.\"\nSome people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have organized and campaigned to stop the use of alleged psychotronic and other mind control weapons. These campaigns have received some support from public figures, including former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who included a provision banning \"psychotronic weapons\" in a 2001 bill that was later dropped, and former Missouri State Representative Jim Guest.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\"Air Loom\"\nOn the Origin of the \"Influencing Machine\" in Schizophrenia\nConspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura\nDirected-energy weapon\nElectronic warfare\nTin foil hat\nThe Psychotronic Man\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEric Tucker, 18 September 2013.

        "title": "Anti-gender movement",
        "wikipedia_content": "The anti-gender movement is a global phenomenon that opposes concepts often referred to as \"gender ideology\" or \"gender theory\". These loosely-defined terms are commonly used by the movement to critique a range of issues related to gender equality, LGBT rights, and gender studies. Originating in the late 20th century, the movement has drawn support from right-wing populist groups, conservative religious organizations, and social conservatives and the far-right worldwide. It views advances in gender inclusion and LGBT rights as threats to traditional family structures, religious values, and established social norms.\nThe movement has been criticized for promoting discrimination and undermining human rights protections, particularly those concerning individuals with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Critics argue that it employs misinformation to delegitimize efforts toward gender inclusion and has been described as a form of moral panic or conspiracy theory.  \nOperating on a transnational scale, the anti-gender movement employs strategies such as public protests, and legislative initiatives to resist policies promoting gender equality and LGBT inclusion. Its opposition targets various domains, including reproductive rights, government-led gender policies, gender mainstreaming, and academic disciplines like gender studies. While some elements within the movement focus specifically on opposing certain LGBT rights, others address broader concerns about gender-related social changes.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn many non-English-speaking countries, anti-gender activists frequently avoid using local translations of the word gender, opting instead for the English term to imply that gender is an imported or foreign concept. The term gender ideology, central to the anti-gender movement, lacks a consistent or coherent definition and encompasses a wide range of issues. Scholars such as Stefanie Mayer and Birgit Sauer describe it as an \"empty signifier,\" while Agnieszka Graff characterizes it as a catch-all term for ideas opposed by conservative Catholics.\nThe terms gender ideology, gender theory, and genderism are often used interchangeably by the movement but are distinct from the academic field of gender studies. Within gender studies, substantial debates and disagreements exist; however, these nuances are typically overlooked by anti-gender proponents. Elizabeth Corredor argues that gender ideology functions as both a political and epistemological challenge to emancipatory ideas surrounding gender, sex, and sexuality. Corredor also notes that the anti-gender movement exploits internal divisions within feminist and LGBT movements to further its agenda.\nThe movement accuses a diverse range of individuals and groups of promoting gender ideology. These include politicians, particularly those identified as liberal, green, or leftist; women's rights and LGBT activists; gender policy officers in public administration; and academics specializing in gender studies. By framing these actors as proponents of gender ideology, the movement consolidates opposition to gender equity and diversity initiatives.\n\n\n== Possible origins ==\n\n\n=== International conferences in the mid-1990s ===\nThe origins of the anti-gender movement have often been traced to discussions within the Catholic Church in the 1990s. These discussions were a response to the outcomes of the United Nations' 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 World Conference on Women, during which the UN began formally recognizing sexual and reproductive rights.  The Holy See expressed concern that such recognition could lead to the classification of abortion as a human right, the erosion of traditional motherhood, and the normalization of homosexuality. Within this context, the term gender was perceived by the Holy See as a strategy to challenge and destabilize the \"natural family\".\nIn 1997, American journalist Dale O’Leary, associated with Opus Dei and known for her anti-abortion stance, published a book titled The Gender Agenda. In the book, O’Leary likened the concept of gender to a covert operation, stating: \"the Gender Agenda sails into communities not as a tall ship, but as a submarine, determined to reveal as little of itself as possible.\" The theological basis for the Catholic Church’s opposition to gender theory was rooted in John Paul II's theology of the body, which emphasized the complementary and distinct roles of the sexes.\nWhile the conceptual framework of the anti-gender movement was established by 2003, visible protests associated with the movement began emerging in European countries around 2012–2013. By 2019, the movement had expanded beyond its Catholic origins, gaining broader support within right-wing political circles, although Catholic actors remain significant proponents.\n\n\n=== 1980s Church origins ===\nAn alternate theory traces the origins of the anti-gender movement to the early 1980s, during the tenure of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI. At that time, Ratzinger observed the popularity of feminist literature in Germany that argued gender was socially constructed. Additionally, he noted changes in German law allowing transgender individuals to legally change their gender, developments that drew Vatican scrutiny. Researcher Mary Anne Case contends that claims for transgender rights, alongside feminist advocacy, were foundational concerns for the Vatican regarding gender. These issues were not recent additions but central to the Church’s focus on the influence of secular legal developments related to gender.\n\n\n=== 1970s U.S. origins ===\nEmerson Hodges, a research analyst at the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), states that the history of the concept ranges back further to the 1970s U.S., where it evolved from the term \"gay agenda\". Hodges states this term was created by religious groups.\n\n\n== Later developments ==\n\n\n=== Trans-exclusionary radical feminism or gender-critical feminism ===\n\nScholars Serena Bassi and Greta LaFleur observe that the trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) movement and the anti-gender movement are rarely treated as distinct, despite their differing origins and objectives. Research by Pearce, Erikainen, and Vincent notes that the term gender ideology, historically central to the anti-gender movement, began to gain traction within trans-exclusionary radical feminist discourse around 2016.\nClaire Thurlow argues that gender-critical feminism often relies on transphobic tropes, moral panics, and essentialist views of men and women. These characteristics, she contends, align trans-exclusionary feminism with anti-feminist reactionary politics and other anti-gender movements. Judith Butler has characterized the anti-gender ideology movement as a neo-fascist phenomenon and has warned leftist individuals and groups against aligning with it.Scholars have highlighted the movement's distinctive nature compared to traditional forms of anti-feminism. Andrea Pető describes it as a \"fundamentally new phenomenon\" aimed at reshaping global sociopolitical orders.\nThis overlap of rhetoric and strategies highlights the connections between trans-exclusionary feminism and broader anti-gender campaigns, despite their differing ideological foundations.\n\n\n=== Foreign influence ===\nA 2021 report commissioned by the European Parliament identified a connection between the rise of the anti-gender movement in Europe and funding from disinformation campaigns. These campaigns were supported in large part by Russia, as well as far-right and Christian right groups. The report highlighted that the Russian government’s geopolitical strategy includes fostering alliances with like-minded groups and deliberately destabilizing the European Union (EU). This strategy involves backing right-wing factions within the EU to amplify dissent and undermine cohesion.\n\n\n== Central figures and issues ==\nKey proponents of the anti-gender movement include Dale O'Leary, Michel Schooyans, Tony Anatrella, Gabriele Kuby, and Marguerite Peeters. According to Łukasz Wawrowski, it is not possible to have a scientific discourse between gender studies scholars and anti-gender proponents, because for the former, gender is a scientific concept that can be researched and falsified, whereas anti-gender proponents derive their arguments from transcendent truths handed down by God, which are not subject to empirical verification. \nIn the European Parliament, the strong election results of national parties such as the Italian Lega Nord, the British Brexit Party (having left parliament on 31 January 2020), the Polish Law and Justice, the Hungarian Fidesz, and the French Rassemblement National contributed to a surge of the anti-gender movement. Most of these MEPs belong to the right-wing populist and nationalist Identity and Democracy (ID) or the European Conservatives and Reformers (ECR) parliamentary groups. However, there are also members of the European Parliament representing these views within the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) groups.\nMembers of the anti-gender movement oppose some reproductive rights, particularly abortion, as well as LGBT rights, especially same-sex marriage, along with some campaigns against gender-based violence. They may also campaign against anti-bullying programs, sex education in schools, and gender studies in higher education. According to Kováts, not all the movements fitting under the \"anti-gender\" label (by opposing \"gender\" or \"gender ideology\") are overtly anti-feminist or anti-LGBT, and the anti-gender movement is a novel phenomenon distinct from previous anti-feminism and homophobia. The anti-gender movement is not synonymous with the far-right, as not all far-right movements espouse anti-gender views, and anti-gender themes extend beyond the far-right.\n\n\n=== \"Gender ideology\" ===\n\nThe anti-gender movement often uses the term \"gender ideology\". Anti-gender activists may portray the European Union and other international organizations as manipulated by several lobbies, such as American billionaires, Cultural Marxists, Freemasons, feminists, the LGBTQ+ lobby, or Jews. To promote the idea that gender is a foreign concept imposed by a secret cabal of corrupt elites, they often use the English word gender, rather than a translation into the local language. Proponents present themselves as defenders of free speech, thought, and conscience against the \"gender ideology\", which they label as \"totalitarian\".\nThe ideology is allegedly pushed by a secret cabal of corrupt elites or foreign entities (such as the European Union, World Health Organization, or United Nations) for the purpose of weakening, undermining, or destroying families, the Catholic Church, the nation, and/or Western civilization. The term has been adopted by Donald Trump and was used in an executed order titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" which seeks to erase official recognition of transgender people and roll back their protections.\n\n\n== Related concepts ==\nAccording to sociologists Roman Kuhar and David Paternotte, \"the invention of 'gender ideology' is closely connected to debates within the Catholic Church\". Pope Francis has stated that \"gender ideology\" would undermine the Catholic Church's position on gender complementarity, comparing it to nuclear weapons, and said it was one of the \"Herods that destroy, that plot designs of death, that disfigure the face of man and woman, destroying creation\". In 2019, the Catholic Church released the first major document dealing specifically with \"gender ideology\", which states that there are only two biologically determined genders or sexes. According to Corredor,\n\nthe Holy See's perspective deeply depends on a stable and predictably correlated relationship between biological sex, gender identity, and heterosexual orientation, which is expressed in the Catholic Church's terms as the one and only natural unity of mind, body, and soul. Because this unity is believed to be rooted within natural and divine law—as a direct creation of God—it transcends political, historical, and social arrangements shaped by man.\nThe anti-gender movement is closely related to right-wing populism, nationalism, and the Christian right. According to Kuhar and Paternotte, \"anti-gender campaigns are [not] the direct consequence of the right-wing populist wave, but the shift towards the Right reinforces these campaigns and provides them with new supporters who took over a concept of 'gender ideology' which shares some ideological structures with right-wing populist ideology\". In line with their populist framing, referendums are often used to secure the outcomes desired by the anti-gender movement.\n\n\n== Analyses and responses ==\nUN Women has described the anti-gender movement as framing \"equality for women and LGBTIQ+ people as a threat to so-called 'traditional' family values [...] to new extremes\" and that \"use hateful propaganda and disinformation to target and attempt to delegitimize people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, and sex characteristics.\"\n\n\n=== Backlash or proactive movement ===\nIt is disputed the extent to which the anti-gender movement is a reaction to events and other movements, or a proactive movement attempting to create social change. Hande Eslen-Ziya argues that the anti-gender movement relies on what she calls \"troll science\", that she describes as \"(distorted) scientific arguments moulded into populist discourse, creating an alternative narrative on the conceptions of gender equality\".\nAn EU-funded research project into the anti-gender movement titled RESIST examined anti-gender rhetoric in parliamentary debates and media coverage in Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom, and found that key actors in promoting and perpetuating anti-gender politics are primarily \"men in the conservative and radical/extreme right in Europe,\" and that media played a role in \"deliberately stoking up a damaging moral panic targeting transgender identities\" that makes transgender people the subject of \"relentless 'debate' about the legitimacy of their rights and lives\".\nAccording to Marta Rawłuszko, the anti-gender movement is, in part, a backlash against the devolution of power from democratically elected national governments to unelected equality bodies and international organizations, such as the European Union, which demand changes. Because these policies are not approved by voters or their elected representatives, they generate a democratic deficit. She notes that \"gender equality policies have been implemented without engaging a wider audience or public debate\".\nHowever, Paternotte argues that picturing the anti-gender movement as a \"backlash\" is \"conceptually flawed, empirically weak and politically problematic\", because comparative research has shown that in different countries, the anti-gender activism is \"sparked by extremely different issues\".\n\n\n=== Conspiracism ===\nAt one point, the idea of gender ideology has been described as a moral panic or conspiracy theory. According to two political psychologists writing for The Conversation, the conspiracy theory contributed to a debate in Poland in 2020 about \"whether the coronavirus pandemic is a punishment for gender theory\". An Ipsos survey in October 2019 found that a plurality of Polish men under 40 believe that \"the LGBT movement and gender ideology\" is the \"biggest threat facing them in the 21st century\". Many regard [Postgenderism] as gender theory.\n\n\n=== Democracy and liberalism ===\nThe emergence and success of anti-gender movements is considered by political scientist Eszter Kováts to be a symptom of a deeper underlying socioeconomic, political, and cultural crisis of liberal democracy and a reaction to neoliberalism. Similarly, political scientist Birgit Sauer refers to these movements as, among other things, a reaction to deregulation, precarization of labor, the erosion of the welfare state and the widening of the gap between the rich and poor. In the journal LuXemburg in 2018, sociologist Weronika Grzebalska and political scientists Eszter Kováts and Andrea Pető analyze the term gender as the \"symbolic glue\" of the anti-gender movement, which unites different political and religious actors who would otherwise not cooperate with each other. They view the \"gender ideology\" that these actors mobilize against as a metaphor for the insecurity and unfairness produced by the neoliberal socioeconomic order.\nThose said to support gender ideology are delegitimized, negating pluralism and undermining liberal democracy, in a similar way to the far-right. Lorena Sosa, assistant professor at the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights (SIM), states that the anti-gender movement has challenged human rights, such as protection from violence against women, and contributed to democratic erosion.\nPető argues that \"The anti-gender movement is not merely another offshoot of centuries-old anti-feminism... The anti-gender movement is a fundamentally new phenomenon that was launched to establish a new world order.\" She also argues that the movement \"is saturated with hatred\"—citing online harassment against gender researchers—and argues that it \"attacks liberalism and therefore democracy\".\nIn 2021 the philosopher Judith Butler described the anti-gender movement as a fascist trend and cautioned self-declared feminists against allying with such movements in targeting trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people.\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service said in 2024 that the \"anti-gender movement\" poses a threat of \"extreme violence\" that could target the LGBTQI+ community.\nIn 2023, Elżbieta Korolczuk argued that \"while the activities of the anti-gender movement are generally non-violent, its discursive strategies and campaigns should be further analysed as possible conveyor belt to engagement in violent extremism\".\n\n\n=== LGBT rights and gender equality ===\nMarie Wittenius of the Gunda Werner Institute for feminism and gender democracy argues that the term \"gender ideology\" \"functions as a broad projection area for racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and transphobia, ethnicnationalist ideas as well as hostility towards elites.\"\nIn August 2021 the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović said the anti-gender movement was \"instrumentalising existing societal prejudices and verbally attacking LGBTI people to achieve political objectives for their own benefit\" and said the targeting of \"LGBTI people for political gain is a costly strategy which harms the lives and well-being of those affected and undermines social cohesion in general.\" The Commissioner said that \"by permeating the political scene, the anti-gender movements are increasingly well-placed to erode the protection of human rights in Europe\" and concluded that \"by standing up for LGBTI people, we defend the equal human dignity of all, protect our societies' wellbeing and the strength of our precious human rights system.\"\nIn February 2022, the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality organised a public hearing on \"Countering the anti-gender movement\", highlighting the anti-gender movement as a threat to gender equality.\nIn March 2024, philosopher Judith Butler published their book titled Who's Afraid of Gender? after being attacked at an airport in São Paulo by \"anti-gender\" protesters in 2017. Butler uses the phrase \"anti-gender ideology movement\" to describe the transnational phenomenon of far-right actors turning \"gender ideology\" into a \"psychosocial fantasy\" that plays into anxieties and fears surrounding the \"traditional family.\"\nIn 2024, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service said that the \"anti-gender movement\" could result in a threat of violence carried out by extremists against the LGBTQI+ community.\n\n\n== By region ==\n\nThe anti-gender movement emerged in Europe in the early 2010s and, as of 2019, was making headway in Latin America. The movement is transnational, with campaigns in different countries borrowing strategies and rhetoric from other countries. However, in individual countries the anti-gender movement overlaps with appeals to nationalism and national sovereignty.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nBefore the emergence of the anti-gender movement, activists and scholars believed that Europe was on an inexorable course towards complete gender equality and full LGBT rights, serious opposition to which was deemed a holdover from the past or else a phenomenon confined to Eastern Europe and Roman Catholic countries. The anti-gender movement proved this perception to be incorrect. Since the 1990s, the European Commission has made eligibility for funding from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund conditional on local gender equality policies, which led to rapid changes after Poland joined the European Union in 2004.\nIn February 2019, the European Parliament passed a resolution against the \"backlash in women's rights and gender equality in the EU\".\n\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\nIn February 2023, the Bulgarian Socialist Party called for a national referendum on \"Gender Ideology\". Later in the month, the party praised a Supreme Court ruling that only biological sex can be listed on government documents and could not be changed.\n\n\n==== Croatia ====\nIn 2012, the SDP-led Croatian government proposed Health Education as a new mandatory school subject in Croatian schools. The program of the school subject was heavily criticized by the Croatian Bishops' Conference and other conservative or religious associations such as GROZD for introducing what they called \"gender ideology\" and \"homosexualism\" to Croatian schools.\nIn 2017, the Croatian government led by the centre-right HDZ announced that it would ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention. While lauded by women's rights associations, this move caused intense criticism from the Croatian Bishop's Conference, the Catholic Church, and various conservative and right-wing figures and associations such as U ime obitelji, for being a convention that supposedly fights violence against women while \"secretly introducing gender ideology\" to Croatian legislature. This was explained by the critics due to the convention text using the terms gender and gender identity in certain sentences, although there had been multiple Croatian laws dating back to at least 2008 already using these terms. Later that year, a citizens' initiative called \"The Truth about the Istanbul Convention\" (Istina o Istanbulskoj) was founded with the aim of \"explaining to Croatian citizens the true purpose\" of the convention, which was supposedly about \"gender ideology\" and an \"attack on Croatian, Catholic, and family values\". The initiative organized protests and rallies in Zagreb and in Split, attended by around 15 thousand people. The initiative aimed to organize a referendum for citizens to decide whether the convention should be ratified, but failed to collect enough signatures required to hold a referendum. Croatian LGBT association Trans Aid sued the initiative for discriminating against transgender people in their communication.\nIn April 2018, the Croatian parliament voted in favor of ratifying the Istanbul Convention. Signing the convention has been a major factor in the rise of political parties on the further right-wing in Croatia in 2020s, such as The Bridge (Most) and Homeland Movement (Domovinski pokret), who took the most conservative voters away from HDZ. The members of these two parties often criticize and attack the \"gender ideology\", transgender individuals, LGBT rights, and the Istanbul Convention, in their speeches.\n\n\n==== France ====\n\nThe anti-gender movement in France is spearheaded by Farida Belghoul and La Manif pour tous (LMPT), a protest movement which originated in early 2013 to oppose same-sex marriage in France and pivoted to opposing equality curricula after same-sex marriage was legalized in May 2013. The anti-gender movement in France has spread false rumors and hoaxes, such as the claim that masturbation is being taught in French kindergartens.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\nIn Germany, right-wing extremists and right-wing populists mobilized against the concept of \"gender madness\", which was characterized as a \"weapon\" against \"the German people\" in a 2013 call by neo-Nazis.\nEven outside the extreme right, there has been critical discussion of gender mainstreaming since 2006, when Eva Herman commented on the role of women in society and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung debated \"political gender reassignment\". Right-wing extremists used this as a prelude to a targeted campaign against gender mainstreaming.\nThe far-right German political party, AfD (Alternative für Deutschland), displays its alignment with the anti-gender movement in its \"Key Points for Germany\" brochure. In the brochure, the AfD positions itself against post-secondary gender studies programs, \"gender-mainstreaming\", and the discussion of sexuality at early ages in school. The AfD further illustrates its anti-gender position in its 2017 \"Manifesto for Germany\". There, the AfD states that \"gender ideology, early sexualisation, governmental funding of gender studies, quota systems and the deprivation of the German language with gender-conforming words have to be terminated\". The AfD has organized anti-gender rallies in cities such as Munich in 2023, emphasizing the perceived threat of \"gender propaganda\" towards children.[1] The anti-gender movement has proven key to the rapid rise of the AfD, with the party projecting the protection of the \"traditional family\" as key to its platform.\nSince 2013, the fundamentalist Christian protest alliance Demo für Alle has mobilized against same-sex marriage and gender mainstreaming. At a Demo für Alle rally in 2014, journalist Birgit Kelle exclaimed that the German state \"grabs for the children to sexualize and reeducate them\", playing into the notion of a loss of \"parental rights\" in educating their own children that the AfD has also used more recently.\n\n\n==== Hungary ====\n\nAccording to Eszter Kováts and Andrea Pető, writing in 2017, there was \"no significant anti-gender movement\" in the country, but \"a palpable anti-gender discourse\", especially in the later 2010s, which to date had only sporadically intersected with the national public debate. They write that the Hungarian anti-gender discourse emerged in 2008, when a textbook was published that was criticized by a Fidesz MP. The politician said that the textbook contained \"gender ideology\" and that \"the greatest danger of this trend is that society will lose its sexual identity\". In politics, the anti-gender discourse first attained prominence in 2010, when the left-wing government inserted a sentence into the national curriculum stating that early childhood educators should \"deliberately avoid any strengthening of gender stereotypes and facilitate the dismantling of the prejudices concerning the social equality of genders\". Right-wing media gave the change much coverage; it was alleged to promote \"gender ideology\".\n\n\n==== Italy ====\nUnder Giorgia Meloni, who was elected prime-minister in 2022 Italian general election, the far-right Italian political party, Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), has placed gender front and centre in its politics. Meloni has frequently emphasized the importance of upholding the gender binary and traditionalist values surrounding family, tying such issues to the protection of the Italian state and religious apparati. At a 2019 rally, Meloni proclaimed: \"I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am Christian.\" Meloni employs her position as a mother situate herself as the \"harbinger of a conservative, yet modern, nation\" while playing up the need to shelter the \"natural family\" from the threat of \"gender ideology.\"\nAnti-gender in Italy has been sponsored by Lega Nord party as well as the groups Pro Vita (associated with the neo-fascist party New Force) and Manif pour Tous Italia, later called Generazione Famiglia. In the 2018 Italian general election, Lega Nord placed members of Catholic organizations on its electoral lists, sealing an anti-gender alliance.\n\n\n==== Lithuania ====\nThe 2020 Lithuanian parliamentary elections and the formation of coalition between the Homeland Union and Freedom Party, which shares a positive stance on LGBT-related policies, led to the formation of anti-gender movements such as the Lithuanian Family Movement and political parties like the National Alliance.\n\n\n==== Norway ====\nGender studies scholar Elisabeth L. Engebretsen has identified groups such as the Norwegian branch of Women's Declaration International and LLH2019, a self-declared sister organization of LGB Alliance, as key anti-gender actors in Norway. According to Engebretsen these groups are part of a \"complex threat to democracy\".\nGender studies scholar Janne Bromseth wrote that the 2022 Oslo shooting \"happened in a context\" and that \"the anti-gender movement has also shifted boundaries in the public debate in Norway in recent years,\" resulting in \"a harsher climate of debate where primarily organized TERFs have been given space to set the agenda for the 'debate on gender' and the alleged threat of 'gender ideology' to the natural order.\"\n\n\n==== Poland ====\n\nIn late 2013, the term gender, which had been confined to academic discourse, became popularized as part of an anti-gender campaign by the right-wing and the Catholic Church. The campaign against \"gender ideology\" was promoted by the national-conservative Law and Justice party which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, by the Catholic Church's hierarchy, and more radically nationalist groups with which Law and Justice had a fluid boundary: All-Polish Youth, the National Rebirth of Poland, and the National-Radical Camp. In 2019, sociologists Piotr Żuk and Paweł Żuk wrote that: \"The right in Poland perceives both feminist and homosexual circles as a threat to the national identity associated with the Catholic religion and as a threat to the traditional family model and social order.\" Anti-LGBT rhetoric from the Polish right increased following the conclusion of the 2015 European migrant crisis, during which anti-migrant rhetoric was prominent. With anti-gender rhetoric, the LGBT community served as the scapegoat or demonized enemy required by populist politics.\nA 2020 survey of a representative sample of 1,000 Poles found that 30% believed in the existence of a gender conspiracy, \"defined as a secret plan to destroy Christian tradition partly by taking control over public media\". The survey found that belief in the gender conspiracy did not correlate with religiosity; it was strongly associated with the belief that the Catholic Church should occupy a privileged position in society and rejection of LGBT people as neighbors. Marta Rawłuszko suggests that Polish people may be prone to finding conspiracies because of the actual plots during communist rule. In June 2020, Polish president Andrzej Duda of Law and Justice drew attention when he called LGBT an \"ideology\" and a form of \"neo-Bolshevism\", ahead of the 2020 Polish presidential election.\nRussia\nVladimir Putin views gender as an \"ideological construction\" created by the Western Europe, playing into the complex meanings of the Russian derogatory term, Gayropa. The term invokes the idea that Western European civilization is facing decadence and decay, symbolized in the dissolution of traditional gender binaries triumphed by contemporary LGBTQ+ movements and queer mainstreaming.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\n\n==== Canada ====\nIn 2023, the \"1 Million March 4 Children\" was a series of anti-LGBTQ protests carried out in various cities throughout Canada. Protesters advocated removing \"pronouns, gender ideology and mixed bathrooms\" in the educational environment. Protesters claimed children were exposed to \"inappropriate\" topics regarding sexuality and gender identity. At least 63 counter-protests were planned or carried out in response to the march. On 19 September 2023, an educational union in Ontario had three offices vandalized with anti-LGBTQ messages. In response to the march, various school boards in Ontario expressed their support for LGBTQ schoolchildren, staff, and families. In Ottawa, two protesters were arrested for \"inciting hatred\" by \"displaying hateful material\". Another person was arrested for disturbance. The protests were condemned by Ottawa mayor Mark Sutcliffe, as well as cities such as Whitehorse.\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nIn 2021, there was a march in Puerto Rico against the introduction of a \"Gender Perspective curriculum\" in public schools that was created under former Governor Alejandro García Padilla and being enacted under Governor Pedro Pierluisi. Marchers said they opposed \"Gender Ideology\". Speakers included Bishop Daniel Fernández Torres, political scientist Agustín Laje, and other religious leaders.\n\n\n=== Latin America ===\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\nFormer President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro has characterized \"gender ideologists\" as a force that is opposed to conservative Christianity. He has also said that he wants to ban \"gender ideology in schools\".\n\n\n==== Colombia ====\nDuring the 2016 Colombian peace agreement referendum, evangelical Christian groups and right-wing politicians who opposed the peace agreement argued that protections for LGBT people in the treaty were \"an instrument to impose gender ideology\". This helped motivate much of the evangelical electorate to oppose the agreement, which was ultimately rejected by voters, 50.22% (No) to 49.78% (Yes).\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\n\n==== Iraq ====\nIn 2023, the Iraqi government issued an order officially prohibiting media from using the word \"gender\". It also mandated that the word \"homosexuality\" be avoided, in favor of \"sexual deviance\".\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\nThe government has supported anti-LGBT marches with the name of \"The Great Family Meeting\" by airing public statements on national TV. The state also suppresses pride parades.\nOne of the primary sources of anti-gender action is religious congregations in Turkey. All major parties of the governing Cumhur İttifakı, and some prominent people from opposition parties also engage in anti-gender rhetoric.\n\n\n== See also ==\n21st-century anti-trans movement in the United Kingdom\nAnti-Gender Campaigns in Europe – a non-fiction book about the movement\nAnti-LGBT rhetoric\nComplementarianism\nDiscrimination against non-binary people\nGender and politics\nGender empowerment\nGender essentialism\nHomosexuality and religion\nIdentity politics\nLGBT-free zone\nSocietal attitudes toward homosexuality\nSociology of gender\nTransphobia\nTERF\n2020s anti-LGBT movement in the United States\nParental rights movement\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnti-gender politics at London School of Economics blogs\nResponding to anti-gender at ILGA-Europe",

        "title": "Strawman theory",
        "wikipedia_content": "The strawman theory (also called the strawman illusion) is a pseudolegal conspiracy theory originating in the redemption/A4V movement and prevalent in antigovernment and tax protester movements such as sovereign citizens and freemen on the land. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and blood and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the \"strawman\") and that one's legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.\n\nPseudolaw advocates claim that it is possible, through the use of certain \"redemption\" procedures and documents, to separate oneself from the \"strawman\", therefore becoming free of the rule of law. Hence, the main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protesters, \"commercial redemption\" and \"get out of debt free\" scams claim that one's debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of person and misunderstanding the distinction between a juridical person and a natural person.\nCanadian legal scholar Donald J. Netolitzky has called the strawman theory \"the most innovative component of the Pseudolaw Memeplex\".\nCourts have uniformly rejected arguments relying on the strawman theory, which is recognized in law as a scam; the FBI considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people who claim it on their tax returns.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe theory appeared circa 1999–2000, when it was conceived by North Dakota farmer turned pseudolegal activist Roger Elvick. A sovereign citizen and tax protester, Elvick was already the primary originator of the redemption movement. The strawman theory overlapped with those of the redemption movement: it eventually became a core concept of sovereign citizen ideology, as it connected their pseudolegal beliefs through an overarching explanation. Around the same period, this set of beliefs was introduced into Canada by Eldon Warman, a student of Elvick's theories who adapted them for a Canadian context. It was further reframed in Canada by the freeman on the land movement, which expanded to other Commonwealth countries.\n\n\n== Assertions ==\n\nThe theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the legal person, often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.\n One argument used by proponents of the strawman theory is based on a misinterpretation of the term capitis deminutio, used in ancient Roman law  for the extinguishment of a person's former legal capacity. Adherents to the theory spell the term \"Capitis Diminutio\", and claim that capitis diminutio maxima (meaning, in Roman law, the loss of liberty, citizenship, and family) was represented by an individual's name being written in capital letters, hence the idea of individuals having a separate legal personality.\nThe strawman theory is coupled with the belief that the government is actually a corporation. Said corporation is supposedly bankrupt and uses its citizens as collateral against foreign debt. After each person's strawman is created through their birth certificate, a loan is taken out in the name of the strawman. The proceeds are then deposited into the secret government account associated with the fictitious person’s name.\nProponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate itself. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the \"straw man\", and John Doe is the baby's \"real\" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity. In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.\nThe theory is also based in part on a misinterpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code, which provides an interstate standard for documents such as driver's licenses or for bank accounts: adherents to the theory see this as evidence that these documents, and the associated laws and financial obligations, do not apply to them, but instead to the \"straw man\".\nTo distinguish themselves from their \"strawman\", pseudolaw advocates may refer to their \"flesh and blood\" identity under by a slightly different name, such as \"John of the family Doe\" instead of \"John Doe\". One scheme, notably advocated by sovereign citizen theorist David Wynn Miller, involves adding punctuation—typically hyphens and colons—to one's name: Miller would write his name as :David-Wynn: Miller or David-Wynn: Miller and verbally said it \"David hyphen Wynn full colon Miller\".\n\nA variation of the strawman theory is found in the \"legal name fraud\" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a personal name and that refusing to use this name removes oneself from the state's authority and a court's jurisdiction.\nRussell Porisky, a Canadian tax protester who emulated Eldon Warman's ideas, promoted a version of the strawman theory by claiming that people could avoid paying taxes by proclaiming themselves to be \"natural persons\", in opposition to the government's version of a \"person\". His concepts relied on a misinterpretation of the definition of a \"person\" in section 248(1) of the Canadian Income Tax Act, which he combined with the strawman theory. Porisky was convicted in 2012 of tax evasion and was sentenced in 2016 to five and a half years in prison.\nBelievers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman is therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of King John's Magna Carta stating in part that, \"no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{\nAdherents to the theory believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their legal liabilities and responsibilities. This is typically attempted by denying they are a 'person' in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents. The use of thumbprints and signatures in red ink, in particular, is meant to distinguish \"flesh and blood\" people from the \"strawman\", since black and blue inks are believed to indicate corporations. The theory also holds that even after \"removing\" their strawman, people must remain cautious and take steps to avoid recognizing the validity of government regulations, which would make them succumb to another \"invisible contract\", experience \"joinder\" and thus fall back under government authority.\nThe belief in the strawman articulates with the redemption movement's fraudulent debt and tax payment schemes, which imply that money from the secret account (known in some variations of the theory as a \"Cestui Que Vie Trust\") can be used to pay one's taxes, debts and other liabilities by simply writing phrases like \"Accepted for Value\" or \"Taken for Value\" on the bills or collection letters, or that the strawman's funds are accessible through the use of certain forms and securities. Such schemes are commonly known as A4V. By attempting to test this aspect of the theory, one may commit various forms of  fraud and face criminal charges. One purported \"redemption\" method for appropriating the money from the alleged secret account is to file a UCC-1 financing statement against one's strawman after having taken the steps to \"separate\" from it.\nOne Canadian freeman on the land \"guru\" known under the pseudonym \"John Spirit\" developed a more sophisticated version of the strawman theory, based on misinterpretations of various international treaties and of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. His arguments were rejected by Canadian provincial and Federal courts.\n\n\n== Legal status of the theory ==\nIn accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a natural person and that of a corporate person. A corporate personhood applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same. They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.\n\nIn 2010, Canadian tax protester and vexatious litigant David Kevin Lindsay appealed his 2008 conviction and sentencing on five counts of failing to file income tax returns, on the ground that he was not a \"person\" as defined by the Income Tax Act. Lindsay's argument was that he had opted out of \"personhood\" in 1996, which made him \"a full liability free will flesh and blood living man\". The Supreme Court of British Columbia rejected his claims, commenting that \"The ordinary sense of the word 'person' in the (Income Tax Act) is without ambiguity. It is clear that Parliament intended the word in its broadest sense.\"\n\nIn 2012, Associate Justice John D. Rooke of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta addressed the strawman theory in detail in his Meads v. Meads decision, concluding: 'Double/split person' schemes have no legal effect. These schemes have no basis in law. There is only one legal identity that attaches to a person. If a person wishes to add a legal 'layer' to themselves, then a corporation is the proper approach. \nJudge Norman K. Moon found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.\nIn 2016, a billboard campaign promoted the \"legal name fraud\" theory in the United Kingdom. Lawyer David Allen Green commented that the theory was \"complete tosh\" and potentially harmful to litigants who would use it in court: \"If people try to use such things to avoid their legal obligations they can end up with county court judgments or even criminal convictions. You may as well walk into court with a t-shirt saying 'I am an idiot'.\"\nIn 2021, the District Court of Queensland dismissed an application that relied on the strawman theory, commenting that this argument \"may properly be described as nonsense or gobbledygook\". The court also pointed out that the strawman scheme, if it had any legal validity, would have adverse consequences for those affected:\n\nAn adult human being with full capacity can sue and be sued. They are subject to the criminal laws of this state. These fundamental propositions cannot be doubted. It is true that a natural person can create a legal entity that has a distinct legal personality – such entities are commonly called companies – but this is an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, the legal personality of the human being. One way of illustrating why this must be so is to consider the consequences of the ability to 'renounce' legal personhood. The law has at times recognised categories of person who did not possess a legal personality. These categories included, before 1833, slaves, who were regarded as chattel property, could be bought and sold, and who had no rights under the law. At times women and children were thought not to possess a legal personality. (...) The fates of people who were in these categories were rarely pleasant. If the applicant were somehow able to renounce his legal personality, he would become a human being without rights. He would be mere property. Such an outcome would be antithetical to our society and system of laws. \nLikewise, Donald J. Netolitzky has stressed that : In modern law, any human being is also innately a legal person, so the historical duality that might serve as a theoretical foundation for \"Strawman\" Theory is now irrevocably and innately melded together into a single unit. Any human being is a legal person.\nIt is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as Idem sonans (Latin for \"sounding the same\") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.: p813  The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the United Kingdom in 1851.\n\nIf two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Alternative facts",
        "wikipedia_content": "\"Alternative facts\" was a phrase used by U.S. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway during a Meet the Press interview on January 22, 2017, in which she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false statement about the attendance numbers at Donald Trump's first inauguration as President of the United States. When pressed during the interview with Chuck Todd to explain why Spicer would \"utter a provable falsehood\", Conway stated that Spicer was giving \"alternative facts\". Todd responded, \"Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\"\nConway's use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" for demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including Dan Rather, Jill Abramson, and the Public Relations Society of America. The phrase was extensively described as Orwellian, particularly in reference to the term doublethink. Within four days of the interview, sales of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four had increased 95-fold, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.\nIn a later article written by Olivia Nuzzi, Conway defended her choice of words where she reportedly stated,  “Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts.” Conway went on to clarify that the phrase was intended to refer to \"additional facts and alternative information,\" suggesting that there could be multiple interpretations of a given set of data.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn January 21, 2017, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held his first press briefing, he accused the media of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd for President Trump's first inaugural ceremony the day before and stated that the ceremony had drawn the \"largest audience to ever witness an inauguration – period – both in person and around the globe\". According to rapid transit ridership data and photographic evidence, Spicer's claims and allegations were false. Aerial images showed that the turnout for Trump's inauguration was lower than the turnout for the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. Spicer claimed that 420,000 people rode the D.C. Metro on inauguration day 2017, compared to 317,000 in 2013. He did not offer a source for his claim, or clarify the time periods being compared. Actual ridership figures between midnight and 11 AM were 193,000 in 2017 and 317,000 in 2013. Full-day ridership was 570,557 in 2017 and 782,000 in 2013.\n\nSpicer also gave incorrect information about the use of white ground coverings during the inauguration. He stated that they were used for the first time during the Trump inauguration and were to blame for a visual effect that made the audience look smaller. The white ground coverings, however, had been used in 2013 when Obama was sworn in for the second term. Spicer did not take questions from the media at the press briefing.\n\nTrump's campaign strategist and counselor, Kellyanne Conway, defended Spicer's statements in a Meet the Press interview. In response to a question from Todd about Trump's false claims regarding the inauguration crowd and the loss of credibility, Conway said:\n\nOur press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that, but the point remains that...\nTodd interrupted her by saying \"Wait a minute. Alternative facts? ... Alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\" In her answer, Conway argued that crowd numbers in general could not be assessed with certainty and objected to what she described as Todd's trying to make her look ridiculous.\nConway later defended her choice of words, defining \"alternative facts\" as \"additional facts and alternative information\".\nTwo days later, Spicer corrected his statements concerning the WMATA ridership levels, stating that he had been relying on statistics \"given to him\". He stood by his widely disputed claim that the inauguration was the most-viewed, stating he also included online viewership in addition to in-person and television in his figures.\nDuring the week following Conway's comments, she discussed \"alternative facts\", substituting the phrases \"alternative information\" and \"incomplete information\". Two days after the Todd interview she defended Trump's travel restrictions by talking about a nonexistent \"Bowling Green massacre\" (she later said she was referring to the arrest of two Iraqis in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for sending aid to insurgents in Iraq), and by falsely claiming that President Obama in 2011 had \"banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months\". Her false statements were described as having \"taken 'alternative facts' to a new level\".\nThe phrase \"alternative facts\" was claimed to be similar to a phrase used in Trump's 1987 book, Trump: The Art of the Deal. In that book, \"truthful hyperbole\" was described as \"an innocent form of exaggeration—and ... a very effective form of promotion\". The book claimed that \"people want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular\". The ghostwriter of the book, Tony Schwartz, said he coined that phrase and claimed that Trump \"loved it\".\nConway later defended her remarks in an interview published in March 2017: \"Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts.\" In a radio interview with Mark Simone that was described by Salon in February 2018, she claimed that professional fact-checkers tend to be political liberals and are \"selecting what [they] think should be fact-checked ... Americans are their own fact checkers. People know, they have their own facts and figures, in terms of meaning which facts and figures are important to them.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nSpicer's press conference and Conway's follow-up comments drew quick reactions on social media. Journalist Dan Rather posted a criticism of the incoming Trump administration on his Facebook page. Rather wrote:\n\nThese are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. When you have a spokesperson for the president of the United States wrap up a lie in the Orwellian phrase \"alternative facts\". ... When you have a press secretary in his first appearance before the White House reporters threaten, bully, lie, and then walk out of the briefing room without the cojones to answer a single question ... Facts and the truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy. And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it. Everyone must answer that question.\nThe New York Times responded with a fact check of statements made during Spicer's press conference. This included a side-by-side photographic comparison of the crowds from Obama's 2009 inauguration and that of Trump.\nJournalist and former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson characterized Conway's comments about alternative facts as \"Orwellian newspeak\", and said \"'Alternative facts' are just lies\". NBC News quoted two experts on the psychology of lying who said that the Trump administration was engaging in gaslighting, and reported that the domain name alternativefacts.com (offline) had been purchased and redirected to an article in Psychology Today on gaslighting.\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary website reported that lookups for the word \"fact\" spiked after Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\". They also got involved by tweeting about it: \"A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality.\" The tweet included a link to their article about Conway's use of the term.\nFollowing Conway's Meet the Press interview and the viral response on social media in which \"alternative facts\" was likened to doublethink and Newspeak, terms from George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, sales of the book increased by more than 9,500 percent, rising to the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com. The New York Times and others attributed this to Conway's statement. Penguin, the book's publisher, ordered a 75,000 unit reprint to meet demand.\nSnopes journalist Alex Kasprak noted that a passage from Carl Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark became a viral meme about alternative facts after the inauguration of Trump; Kasprak commented \"the proffered description of that nightmare was authentic\".\nOn January 24, 2017, the Public Relations Society of America, a public relations trade group, put out a statement that said \"Encouraging and perpetuating the use of alternative facts by a high-profile spokesperson reflects poorly on all communications professionals.\"\n\n\n=== Legal usage ===\nIn a Breitbart News article dated January 23, 2017, editor Joel Pollak defended Conway's use of \"alternative facts\" by arguing that it was a \"harmless, and accurate term in a legal setting, where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide\". However, The Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries did not yield any results for the term.\"\nOn February 23, 2017, fifteen professors of law, some of whom are themselves obliged to adhere to the District of Columbia Bar Association's Rule of Professional Conduct, rule 8.4(a), filed a disciplinary complaint with the D.C. Bar's Office of Disciplinary Conduct. Their complaint applies against Conway, a lawyer in public office, on the grounds that under rule 8.4(c): \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\", because of Conway's pattern of misrepresentation as well as her misuse of words such as \"massacre\" at a time when she holds high public office. The letter of complaint makes a specific reference to the use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" as being involved in one of the cases of alleged misconduct, citing as a reference for its claim an opinion article by The New York Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Fandos.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe term alternative facts became a mainstay in popular culture, from late night comedians to serious news outlets. Jimmy Fallon created a segment \"Two Truths and an Alternative Fact\" on The Tonight Show. Stephen Colbert criticized Conway for saying she was not Inspector Gadget or \"in the job of having evidence\" on The Late Show, claiming \"Kellyanne Conway has only one move: 'Go, go, alternative facts!'\"\nCNN's ad campaign \"Facts First\" was a direct response to the concept of alternative facts and fake news. USA Today listed it in their \"Glossary of Trump terms\".\nBoth Robert De Niro and Steven Spielberg referred to alternative facts in their acceptance speech at the National Board of Review awards for the Spielberg film The Post. Spielberg said: \"We are in a fight and it's a fight not just about alternative facts but it's a fight for the objective truth.\"\nThe 2017 short film Alternative Math is a satire about the absurdity of the concept of alternative facts.\nOn January 16, 2018, German linguists declared the phrase \"alternative facts\" the un-word of the year 2017. It was also chosen by Austrian linguists as the un-word of the year in December 2017.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nd'Ancona, Matthew (2017).

        "title": "Shadow government (conspiracy theory)",
        "wikipedia_content": "The shadow government, also referred to as cryptocracy, secret government, or invisible government, is a family of theories based on the notion that real and actual political power resides not only with publicly elected representatives but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic institutions. According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government, which is the true executive power.\nSome of the groups proposed by these theories as constituting the shadow government include central banks, Freemasons, communists, Nazis, the Rothschilds, intelligence agencies, think tanks, organized Jewry, the Vatican, Jesuits, or Catholics in general, as well as secret societies, moneyed interests, extraterrestrials, Satanists, and globalist elites and supranational organizations who seek to manipulate policy in their own interest or in order to serve a larger agenda that is hidden from the general public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLiterature on the subject postulates the existence of a secret government which is the true power behind the apparent government. Examples of such literature include works by Dan Smoot, William Guy Carr, Jim Marrs, Carroll Quigley, Gary Allen, Alex Jones, Des Griffin, G. Edward Griffin, David Icke, and Michael A. Hoffman II. Some of these authors believe members of the secret government may represent or be agents for groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations, United Nations, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Tavistock Institute, the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, the World Health Organization, George Soros, and the Koch Brothers, in co-operation with international banks and financial institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the Bank for International Settlements. \nMilton William Cooper claimed that the shadow government was in cooperation with extraterrestrial aliens. His 1991 book Behold a Pale Horse, influential among \"UFO and militia circles\", describes \"the doings of the secret world government\" and \"a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati's declaration of war upon the people of America\". Cooper claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with aliens. Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the US government, but later retracted these claims. He accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens \"manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult\", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them. Also popularizing the idea was the hit US television show, The X-Files, in the series' story arc, Mythology of The X-Files.\nDuring the American Revolution, Committees of Safety were different local committees of Patriots that formed a shadow government to take control of the Thirteen Colonies away from British royal officials.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeep state\nFifth column\nNew World Order (conspiracy theory)\nPower behind the throne\nPuppet regime\nShadow cabinet\nSmoke-filled room\nSuccession crisis\n\n\n== References ==",

Proponents of the theory alleging the Committee's existence believe it to be an international council that organizes politics, commerce, banking, media, and the military for centralized global efforts.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe theory dates to a statement made by German politician Walther Rathenau in a 1909 article, \"Geschäftlicher Nachwuchs\", in Neue Freie Presse:\n\nThree hundred men, all of whom know one another, guide the economic destinies of the Continent and seek their successors from their own milieu.\nIn context, Rathenau was actually deploring the oligarchic implications of this statement, and did not suggest that the \"three hundred\" were Jewish. However, by 1912, Theodor Fritsch had seized upon the sentence as an \"open confession of indubitable Jewish hegemony\" and as proof that Rathenau was the \"secret Kaiser of Germany\". The idea became more popular after World War I, and the spread of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Rathenau addressed the issue in a 1921 letter, stating that the three hundred referred to were leaders in the business world, rather than Jews.\nAfter Rathenau's assassination in June 1922, one of his assassins explicitly cited Rathenau's membership in the \"three hundred Elders of Zion\" as justification for the killing.\n\n\n== Later theory ==\nArthur Cherep-Spiridovich wrote that the group may also be known as the \"Hidden Hand\", which is headed by the Rothschild family of international financiers and based loosely around many of the top national banking institutions and royal families of the world.

        "title": "Freeman on the land movement",
        "wikipedia_content": "The freeman on the land movement (sometimes spelled freeman-on-the-land or abbreviated as FOTL), also known as the freemen of the land, the freemen movement, or simply freemen, is a loose group of individuals who adhere to pseudolegal concepts and conspiracy theories implying that they are bound by statute laws only if they consent to those laws. \nFreemen on the land are mostly present in Commonwealth countries. The movement appeared in Canada in the early 2000s, as an offshoot of the sovereign citizen movement which is more prevalent in the United States.\nThe name \"freeman on the land\" describes a person who is literally a \"free man\" on the land where they live. Movement members believe that they can declare themselves independent of the government and the rule of law, holding that the only \"true\" law is their own idiosyncratic interpretation of \"common law\". Freemen on the land also advocate schemes to avoid taxes which they consider to be illegitimate. In Canada, courts and scholars use the technical phrase \"Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments\" (OPCA) as an umbrella term for freemen on the land, the precursor \"Detaxer\" movement, sovereign citizens, their pseudolegal theories and the vexatious litigation based on them.\nFreeman on the land arguments are legally baseless. Besides Canada, freemen on the land's pseudolegal claims have been argued in the courts of Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Ireland but have always been rejected. The movement's influence peaked in Canada during the late 2000s and early 2010s; it has since declined significantly.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere is some cross-over between the two groups which call themselves freemen and sovereign citizens (and some others). The freeman on the land movement comes from the encounter of the Canadian and American traditions of pseudolaw theories. Canada developed its own tradition of pseudolaw and tax protesters, which merged over time with ideas from the American sovereign citizen movement.\nThe sovereign citizen movement originated in the radical and racist anti-government movements in the US in the 1960s and 1970s, though the far right aspects of its ideology were gradually diluted over time. Sovereign citizen ideas garnered more support during the American farm crisis of the late 1970s and 1980s and a financial crisis in both the US and Canada in the same period.\nWith the advent of the Internet and continuing during the 21st century, people throughout the English-speaking world who share the core beliefs of these movements (which may be loosely defined as \"see[ing] the state as a corporation with no authority over free citizens\") have been able to connect and share their beliefs.\nThe pseudolegal ideas originated with the Sovereign Citizen movement in the United States were first imported into Canada through the \"Detaxer\" movement around the turn of the 21st century. \"Detaxer\" concepts were adapted by other \"gurus\" and eventually gave birth to the freeman on the land movement. By the late 2000s they had also started to spread to freeman groups in the UK and other Commonwealth countries, and to various groups in Europe.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\n\n==== Pre-Detaxer movement ====\nCanada's tax protester and pseudolaw tradition was influenced by earlier idiosyncratic interpretations of Canadian law and constitution. In 1937, R. Rogers Smith self-published Alberta has the Sovereign Right to Issue and Use Its Own Credit, which argued that the British North America Act and the Statute of Westminster 1931 did not make Canada an independent nation, but left it a British dependency, and that the constitutional division of powers between the Canadian federal government and provincial governments was not defined. In 1945, Walter Frederick Kuhl MP delivered a speech in the House of Commons in which he argued, based on Smith's theories, that the Canadian constitution was defective and needed to be amended. Kuhl's argument formed a basis to refuse to pay income tax, for it alleged that the federal government had no taxation authority and that all other government jurisdictions remained with the provinces. The speech was reprinted and distributed as a booklet titled Canada, a Country Without a Constitution. Smith and Kuhl's texts were later used as references by the \"Detaxer\" movement.\nAccording to Canadian legal scholar Donald J. Netolitzky, the \"patient zero\" for Canadian pseudolegal tax protester arguments was Gerrald Hart, an electronics shopkeeper from Winnipeg, who engaged during the 1950s in anti-tax efforts which included submitting tax returns that rejected liability instead of correctly reporting his shop's tax liabilities. In The Queen v. Hart Electronics Limited, Hart was charged with failure to file a tax return. The Manitoba Court of Appeal acquitted Hart, ruling that his unsigned, unusual tax return was still a tax return, and refused to consider whether the tax return was adequate. Hart also claimed that the Supreme Court ruling in Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General) (1951) SCR 31 meant that income tax acts passed by the Canadian government since 1971 were unconstitutional. He published the Hart System of Effective Tax Avoidance that described his strategies to avoid taxes.\nIn the early 1990s, Murray Gauvreau worked with social credit group Pilgrims of Saint Michael to promote tax protester strategies based on Hart's System of Effective Tax Avoidance via the organisation's Michael journal. Gauvreau's arguments, based on filing defective tax returns, as well as constitutional arguments based on the division of powers, were rejected by the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta.\nIn the 1980s and the 1990s, fiscal misconception conspiracy theories similar to those found in American tax protester movements were also adopted by Canadian tax protester groups. In 1999, arguments based on the constitutional division of powers, earlier used by Hart and Gauvreau, were further developed by Robert A. Marquis in his book Fraud, Deception, Manipulation, though Marquis failed to mention that these arguments had already been rejected by Canadian courts.\nCanadian pseudolegal anti-tax activism initially had little resonance outside marginal right-wing communities. This changed in the late 1990s, when the \"Detaxer\" movement became influential in Canada.\n\n\n==== Detaxer movement (1998) ====\n\nAround 1998, Canadian pilot Eldon Gerald Warman, who had been exposed to American pseudolegal concepts while residing in the United States, promoted ideas adapted from the American sovereign citizen movement through his website Detax Canada and the organization of seminars. Warman claimed to be subject only to \"common law\", referring not to modern case law, but to historical English case law. He credited as his mentor American activist Roger Elvick, who had founded the redemption movement in the United States; the redemption movement notably promoted the strawman theory, which is based on the assertion that state legislative authority only extends to an individual's legal person, and not to their natural person.\nWarman claimed that whereas in the United States, an individual's Social Security Number was used to attach this \"strawman\" to a natural person, in Canada, this was done using a birth certificate. Around 2000, Warman also worked with Ernst Friedrich Kyburz and Sikander Abdulali \"Alex\" Muljiani to promote anti-tax ideas based on the sovereign citizen movement's beliefs, at joint seminars across Canada. He also used misinterpretations of Canadian case law to justify unrestricted automobile use.\nWarman asserted that government authority over an individual arises from a contract, that statute law cannot be used to impose on a person a contract that deprives the individual of property rights and freedom to travel, and that individual rights and liberties derived from Anglo-Saxon common law, as well as Magna Carta. He instructed his followers to use disclaimers in income tax returns, to reject correspondence from the Canada Revenue Agency and to refrain from citing the Constitution of Canada in court, to avoid entering into an assumpsit contract.\nHe asked them instead to deny the \"strawman\", claim \"common law\" jurisdiction, and otherwise claim the right to silence. Warman also used pre-Detaxer arguments to assert that the Canadian constitution was defective, and proposed a new constitutional document, the Magna Carta Kanata. However, he criticised other pre-Detaxer strategies and suggested that they were secretly sponsored by the Canada Revenue Agency itself.\nIn 1999, after he was charged with assaulting a police officer, Warman attempted to use these pseudo-legal arguments to assert that the Provincial Court of British Columbia did not have jurisdiction over him in R v Warman (2000) BCPC 0022. On denying Warman's appeal, the British Columbia Court of Appeal noted that his arguments were based on a rejection of state and judicial authority.\nWarman, who died in 2017, was emulated by several other \"gurus\". Some Detaxer methods relied on technical loopholes, and were occasionally successful in doing so, while others attacked the taxation authority itself. One \"guru\" who enjoyed particular notoriety was Russell Porisky, who operated an organization known as the Paradigm Education Group. Porisky promoted Detaxer theories via multilevel marketing strategies, making them more broadly accessible to the public. Porisky's concept was that people could avoid paying taxes by declaring themselves a \"natural person\" rather than taxpayers. His method relied on combining the definition of a \"person\" in section 248(1) of the Canadian income tax Act with the strawman theory. Porisky was first convicted of tax evasion in 2012. In 2016, he was sentenced to five and a half years in prison and ordered to pay C$259,482 in fines for tax evasion and for having counselled others to commit fraud.\nThe Detaxer movement went through a decline after 2008, due to the repeated failure of its concepts in courts. As of 2016, the last \"guru\" actively teaching Detaxer theories was David Kevin Lindsay, a serial litigant who participated in hundreds of court cases as a plaintiff or as an \"agent\" acting on behalf of others. In 2010, Lindsay unsuccessfully argued before the Supreme Court of British Columbia that he should not be paying taxes because he was not a \"person\" as defined by the Income Tax Act but \"a full liability free will flesh and blood living man\". Linsday's own failure in court eroded his status as a pseudolaw guru. In 2016, Lindsay complained that Canadian pseudolaw affiliates and gurus had become too influenced by US concepts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lindsay re-emerged as a leader of anti-mask and anti-lockdown protests in British Columbia.\n\n\n==== Origin of freeman on the land movement (from 2000) ====\nThe freeman on the land movement in Canada originated with one single key \"guru\", Robert Arthur Menard. A former construction worker and stand-up comic, Menard entered pseudolaw as a student of Detaxer theories, which he later espoused on the Internet, using online forums such as \"Cannabis culture\", videos and freely distributed ebooks. He became more invested in pseudolaw around 2000, as he was having a dispute with child welfare authorities over access to and custody of the child of a teenaged partner.\nMenard's guru activity initially focused on how birth documentation allegedly allows the state to control children. He later expanded his claims, asserting that he could immunize people from Canadian law as a whole.  Menard first used the phrase \"Freeloader-on-the-Land\" to describe how people could ignore their social and legal obligations while still benefiting from Canadian services and infrastructures. He coined the name \"freeman on the land\" around 2005.\nMenard showed little conceptual innovation, and mostly used simplified versions of Detaxer theories which he restated as fact. However, his skillful use of social media helped him gain more followers than Warman. He also borrowed concepts from Mary Elizabeth Croft, another pseudolaw ideologue. Menard's only personal contribution to pseudolegal theory is his argument that the secret \"strawman\" bank account is reflected in the Charter, section 7 reference to the \"security of the person\" which, he argues, references to the \"birth bond\" of the strawman. Otherwise, his theories showed little documentary foundation. In his 2011 book With Lawful Excuse, Menard claims that Canada was salvaged as a corporation operated by bankers in London after the death of Queen Victoria; in the same book, he later claims that Canada is a \"US corporation\", that Canadian provincial governments are a \"legal fiction\", and finally references Pre-Detaxer theories that Canada's constitution is defective. Donald J. Netolitzky comments that despite Menard's stature in pseudolegal circles, his understanding of law is \"best described as unsophisticated\", and \"grossly inferior\" to that of Detaxer gurus such as David Kevin Lindsay.\nThe notable difference between the Detaxer and freemen on the land populations is that the latter shows a politically leftist orientation, open to environmentalism, anti-globalization concepts and marijuana advocacy. Freeman on the land ideology developed in Canada mostly as a criminal culture: most of its courtroom applications were aimed to legitimise illegal activities. Variations by other gurus  may also include New Age concepts.  Besides claiming that governments and statute laws are illegitimate and refusing to pay income tax, movement members reject the use of official documents such as health cards and driver's licences.\n\n\n==== Developments ====\nThe movement attracted a broad range of people opposed to the federal government of Canada, including environmentalists and First Nations people. Like their Canadian \"Detaxer\" predecessors and American sovereign citizens, Canadian freemen on the land put a strain on public resources, notably using paper terrorism by filing numerous documents written in incoherent language, clogging the court system. In 2008, Menard was prohibited from appearing in court as a counsel and giving legal advice in British Columbia.\nIn 2012, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service reported that freemen on the land were causing a \"major policing problem\". Adherents had violent encounters with police forces and the movement attempted to create its own \"corps of peace officers\". In 2013, Canadian media reported the case of a Calgary woman whose tenant, a freeman on the land, had claimed her property as his own and declared it an \"embassy\". In 2015, a police officer was murdered in Edmonton by a man who adhered to freeman on the land ideology.\nMenard also launched a financial scheme, the Association of Canadian Consumer Purchasers (ACCP), through which people could purportedly receive the \"Menard Card\", a $2,500.00 debit card, in return for a  $250.00 per month subscription.\nAround 2010, Menard's leadership was challenged by another \"guru\", Dean Clifford, who advocated a more confrontational approach against government and court authorities. Unlike Menard who had begun his activities in far-left circles, Clifford had a white supremacist and skinhead background: his earlier adherents came largely from these environments. In February 2013, Clifford was jailed for minor offenses. His status escalated dramatically when he was released one month later, and claimed to have successfully used freeman on the land methods to get out of prison. He was arrested again in November of the same year. In 2015, he was sentenced to three years in prison for numerous drug and weapons offenses. After his release, he endeavored to restore his status in the pseudolaw community and operated for a time a company which purported to discharge customers' debts through an \"A4V\" scheme. In 2018, due to his use of that scheme, Clifford was declared a vexatious litigant in Alberta and made subject to strict court access restrictions.\nAnother freeman on the land guru, a Québec resident known under the pseudonym \"John Spirit\", began in 2012 to market his pseudolegal services on the Internet. He stood out by using actual Canadian legal resources to develop pseudolegal concepts more sophisticated than Menard's, as well as a new definition of the strawman theory based on misinterpretations of international texts. He notably asserted that international treaties are supraconstitutional authorities in Canada, as they are incorporated into the Charter. He specifically argued that one could enforce international treaties via Section 7 of the Charter to eliminate one's \"strawman\" and become free of legal constraints.  According to Donald J. Netolitzky, whereas Menard and Clifford's theories are little more than \"empty mantras\", Spirit's arguments are grounded on specific court decision passages often cited in Supreme Court jurisprudence and may have triggered a shift towards \"more conventionally argued\" freeman on the land litigation. However, Spirit's attempt to develop a serious freeman on the land legal thinking proved a \"two-edged sword\" when his concepts were refuted in Canadian provincial and Federal courts.\n\n\n==== Decline ====\nSince the early 2010s, the freeman on the land movement has declined in Canada due to the persistent failure of its concepts in court.  Many freemen on the land suffered serious legal, financial, or family consequences for putting the movement's ideas into practice. The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta's 2012 Meads v. Meads decision, which refuted in detail freeman on the land theories and other pseudolegal concepts, has since been used as case law against pseudolegal tactics by courts in Canada as well as in other Commonwealth countries. The Quatloos.com online community was also instrumental in discrediting freeman on the land ideology, by publishing court documents which showed that Menard and Clifford were ineffectual when involved in court cases (including their own) and by exposing that Menard himself did not practice his own doctrines, as he used a driver's license while claiming they were unnecessary.\nThe decline of Menard as a guru was also caused by the lack of success of his other initiatives such as the creation of the \"peace officers\" corps, of an alternative community and government structure, and a touring arts and crafts event. His reputation in the freeman on the land community was especially damaged by the failure of his AACP scheme, when the substantial numbers of Canadian freemen who had paid to subscribe to it never received their \"Menard Cards\" and other promised benefits. Eventually, Menard largely withdrew from the scene while newer \"gurus\" met with little success.\nClifford was mostly discredited following his second 2013 arrest, and after his freeman on the land tactics proved unable to prevent his conviction. He eventually disavowed his original pseudolegal theories, went on to promote equity as superior to common law, and appeared to revert back to his earlier right-wing and racist associations.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a new surge in pseudolegal activities in Canada, it has not benefited the local freeman of the land movement, which remained moribund as of 2022. In the meantime, the more US-specific sovereign citizen movement has gained traction in Canada. However, incidents involving self-described freemen of the land are still reported in Canada.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nFreeman on the land ideology reached the United Kingdom in the late 2000s. Use of pseudolaw in the UK is difficult to evaluate, but there is clear evidence of an active community using concepts mostly derived from Canadian freeman on the land sources. Unlike Canadian freemen who primarily use pseudolaw to justify illegal activity, UK litigants mostly focus on economic issues, such as avoiding Council Tax, motor vehicle registration and insurance, television licence fees, mortgages, and other debts.\nBritish freeman on the land outlets have included the \"Get Out Of Debt Free\" website that purported to eliminate debts through \"A4V\" schemes and promissory notes processes, and \"WeReBank\", a \"financial\" entity that offered subscribers blank cheques to pay off large sums. In addition to the economic aspects of their ideology, British freemen gradually developed an anti-government political perspective that is more comparable to the American sovereign citizens than to their Canadian freemen on the land counterparts.\nIn 2016, billboards in the UK advertised the freeman on the land concept of \"legal name fraud\", a variation of the strawman theory claiming that \"all legal names are owned by the Crown, and therefore using a legal name without their written permission is fraud\".\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, where freeman on the land tactics were imported roughly at the same time as in the United Kingdom, local gurus have created Ireland-specific motifs of defective state authority, citing the Constitution of Ireland and presenting Brehon law, rather than English common law, as the true source of legislation.\nThe expansion of pseudolegal \"freeman\" activity in Ireland was fostered by a period of economic difficulties in the late 2000s, following the burst of a real-estate bubble which led people to seek remedies for their financial woes. Multiple entities offered their customers relief from debts and mortgages through the use of fraudulent, pseudolegal schemes. One such entity is the Rodolphus Allen Family Private Trust, which promised immunity to foreclosure to its subscribers and advocated \"strawman\" concepts.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAustralia has its own tradition of pseudolaw, dating back to the 1980s and sovereign citizen concepts were imported into Australia during the 1990s. Local gurus have been using Australia-specific concepts; however, Australian pseudolaw litigants may also identify as freemen on the land or use Canadian-style freeman documents. \nThere have been several court cases testing the core concept, none successful for the \"freemen\". Local freeman on the land activists have made particular efforts to appeal to Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nUnlike Australia, New Zealand has not developed local concepts, even though many New Zealander pseudolaw litigants are Maori who base their claims on their ethnic status. Pseudolegal documents in New Zealand have shown influence from multiple foreign sources, including Canadian freemen on the land ideology.\n\n\n== Groupings ==\nA number of anti-state movements with similar tactics but different ideologies may receive the label \"freeman on the land\".\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nRobert Arthur Menard, the originator of the movement, was called the \"Director of Freemen on the Land\", though he likened the movement to \"a voluntary relay race\" and said that it was \"way too unorganized to have a hierarchical structure\". Canadian legal scholar Donald J. Netolitzky commented that the \"freeman\" population had an \"amorphous\" character and was \"less an organization or 'movement' than a collection of individuals who hold powerful anti-authority beliefs\".\nAn article published by The Journal of Intelligence, Conflict, and Warfare identified nine classes of adherents of freeman on the land and similar anti-authority groups in Canada:\n\nfantastical believers, who operate in an alternative frame of reference that may be difficult to distinguish from mental illness;\nconspiracy theorists, whose paranoid worldview is rich in blame to outside entities;\nescapists, who want autonomy and tend to be loners;\ndabblers/opportunists, who see the movement as a chance to get out from under sudden setbacks including family or financial problems;\nsympathisers, who share the ideologies and anti-government views, but continue to fulfil their obligations and do not engage in confrontational or pseudolegal tactics;\nthe committed, with active, ongoing anti-authority conflict, which may or may not have started with a sudden event like the dabblers/opportunists;\nviolent extremists, who are rare, but move past pseudolegal tactics;\nentrepreneurs, who exploit other adherents by means such as \"money for nothing\" schemes or providing pseudolegal services or documents for a fee; and\n\"gurus\", either with an established following or developing one, who seek visibility in the movement with their take on world events and pseudolaw theories.\nAssociate Justice John D. Rooke, in his 2012 Meads v. Meads decision, describes the freeman on the land movement as having \"libertarian and right wing overtones\". In a 2019 article of the Alberta Law Review, Donald J. Netolitzky disagrees with this assessment, which he considers a confusion between the freeman on the land and sovereign citizen movements: according to Netolitzky, a sociological study has shown that, while very hostile to state and institutional actors, the freeman on the land population is predominately left leaning. He adds, however, that freemen on the land are ideologically heterogeneous and that there is a \"broad overlap\" between their beliefs and those of the sovereign citizens, which leads to confusion between the two.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, there is some cross-over between groups which call themselves freemen on the land and sovereign citizens (and some others). From the 2010s, there has been a growing number of Freemen targeting Indigenous Australians, with groups with names like Tribal Sovereign Parliament of Gondwana Land, the Original Sovereign Tribal Federation (OSTF) and the Original Sovereign Confederation. OSTF Founder Mark McMurtrie, an Aboriginal Australian man, has produced YouTube videos speaking about \"common law\", which incorporate Freemen beliefs. Appealing to other Aboriginal people by partly identifying with the land rights movement, McMurtrie played on their feelings of alienation and lack of trust in the systems which had not served Indigenous people well. A group called United Rights Australia (U R Australia) has a Facebook presence, and there are other websites promulgating Freemen/Sovereign Citizen ideas.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, freeman on the land ideology has influenced The People's United Community (TPUC), a group created in 2007 to oppose taxation, European integration and the Conservative government. TPUC espoused one UK-specific concept of defective state authority, called \"lawful rebellion\", namely that a freeman could write to the Queen and invoke Clause 61 of the Magna Carta to negate Royal (and, by extension, government) authority. However, Clause 61 empowers 25 Barons to restrict the monarch, and does not concern the general public nor mention \"lawful rebellion\".\nDuring the early 2010s, freeman ideas also spilled into the UK Occupy movement. In 2018, The White Pendragons, a group of freemen on the land whose ideology combined pseudolaw with anti-government, anti-immigration and anti-Islam views, tried to \"arrest\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, the Tir na Saor website, which operated from 2009 to 2016, was a major hub for the Irish pseudolaw community and showed clear Canadian freeman influences. The most unusual development of freeman ideology in Ireland was the creation of a political party, Direct Democracy Ireland, co-founded in 2010 by anti-foreclosure activist and serial litigant Ben Gilroy. Direct Democracy Ireland did poorly at elections and the Irish freeman on the land movement eventually went into decline. In 2024, Direct Democracy Ireland was rebranded as Liberty Republic and ran six candidates in the 2024 Irish general election. None of the candidates were elected.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nFreemen on the land, like sovereign citizens, share the core beliefs commonly seen in pseudolaw. Their theories have been broadly defined as \"see[ing] the state as a corporation with no authority over free citizens\". Freemen's beliefs are largely based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking, and do not stand up to legal scrutiny. Freemen arguments have been rejected in the courts of various countries, including England, Wales, Canada, and Australia.\nThe Canadian case Meads v. Meads (see below) identified five major themes in the freeman on the land belief systems:\n\n\n=== Claimed exemption from jurisdiction ===\n\nA number of arguments are employed to claim immunity from law. These arguments are described in Meads v. Meads as \"magic hats\", as a reference to the fact that many pseudolegal tactics resemble magic rituals more than actual law.\nMany freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of admiralty or maritime law, which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding terms, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a ship and the court's occupants as passengers, and may claim that those leaving are \"men overboard\".\nFreemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking \"Do you have a claim against me?\" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.\nFreemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, currencies are backed not by gold but by the people (or the \"legal fiction of their persons\").\nBritish freemen describe people as creditors of the UK corporation.  Therefore, they claim, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.  They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.\nOne document commonly used by the freeman on the land movement to claim immunity from jurisdiction is the so-called \"Notice of Understanding, Intent, and Claim of Right\" (also abbreviated as \"NOUICR\"), a type of pseudolegal document to be delivered to government actors, which purportedly allows its users to \"opt out\" of state obligations while maintaining or creating the rights they desire. Menard created the original NOUICR template, which was later adapted and revised by many other freemen \"gurus\" to expand the rights claimed in the document or to make it appear more authoritative. Freemen on the land believe that such documents will make them immune from prosecution or from state sanction. The signed document, often notarised, is sent to the King and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words \"Whereas it is my understanding\" and goes on to state the freemen's understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.\n\n\n=== Laws as contracts ===\nFreemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call \"common\" (case) and \"natural\" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use \"fraud or mischief\" in contracts. In a 2004 video titled \"Bursting Bubbles of Government Deception\", Menard claimed that one does not have to follow the law if he has \"constructively den[ied] consent to be governed\" via contract with the government.  Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law jurisdiction where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the consent of the governed.\nFreemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a \"child of the province\" or \"ward of the state\", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.\nFreemen believe that the government has to establish \"joinder\" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is \"John Smith\" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent, as they believe that statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, they believe that statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message \"No contract—return to sender\".\n\n\n=== Silence as consent ===\nOne common pseudolegal belief shared by Freemen of the land is that \"silence means consent\", meaning that any claim or alleged statement of fact placed in a sworn document is proven true unless rebutted. This belief extends to Freemen's use of the \"Notices of Understanding, Intent, and Claim of Right\" which they consider stand as fact if any government actor can be persuaded to file them and does not rebut them afterwards.\n\n\n=== Dual identity ===\n\nA common pseudolegal belief, originating in the redemption and sovereign citizen movements, is that people have two parts to their existence: their \"flesh and blood\" identity as individuals and their legal \"person\". The former is joined to the latter by the birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a \"strawman\" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this strawman is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as \"John of the family Smith\" instead of \"John Smith\". \"Notices of Understanding, Intent, and Claim of Right\" documents may or may not refer to the \"strawman\".\n\n\n=== Secret financial instruments ===\n\nAn implication of the strawman theory, also derived from the concepts of the redemption movement, is that there is some government-controlled account linked to a person through the birth certificate. This aspect of the theory suggests that the value of that account can be applied to financial obligations and even criminal charges. The concept behind this scheme has sometimes been called \"money for nothing\".\n\n\n== Court cases ==\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\n\n=== England and Wales ===\nAs of 2011 there was no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law in the UK.\n\nElizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a child custody case; she was given a nine-month prison sentence for contempt of court (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words \"no contract\" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by among other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styling and addressing herself and Haigh in irregular fashion as \"Elizabeth of the Watson family\" and \"Victoria of the Haigh family\" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.\nMark Bond of Norfolk, England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a \"notice of intent\" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the Norwich Evening News, \"Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there.\" He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.\nDean Marshall of Preston, Holderness, near Hull, East Yorkshire, England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 cannabis plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister David Cameron as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Kingston upon Hull Crown Court dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.\nDoug Jones of Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for contempt of court. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving an endorsement on his driving licence. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the September 11 attacks and London bombings.  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated \"On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again.\"\nGavin Kaylhem of Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, England, wilfully refused to pay his council tax debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a \"freeman\" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with magistrates' questions.\nMandeep Sandhu of Tividale, Sandwell, West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean \"entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil\". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.\nErrol Denton, a live blood analysis practitioner, was charged with offences under the Cancer Act 1939. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, he used a freeman defence. Since both the prosecution and the defence were rare, it was reported in the press. On 20 March 2014 he was convicted on all nine counts and fined £9,000 plus around £10,000 in costs.\nIn June 2019, a man who refused to register his son's birth under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 lost an appeal to the London High Court after using a freeman defence. He cited an obscure law, the Cestui Que Vie Act 1666, and argued that registering the birth would be equivalent to \"an entry into a ship's manifest\", in which the child becomes \"an asset to the country which has boarded a vessel to sail on the high seas\", thus causing him to become controlled by the state. The judge ruled that the local council had the right to step in as the child's \"institutional parent\" to register the birth.\nCases have also been reported in Gloucestershire, Somerset, and Cornwall.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nBobby Sludds appeared in court in County Wexford in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.) A similar case occurred in County Wexford in 2013, with a bankrupt businessman imprisoned for contempt of court being returned to jail for refusing to recognise the authority of the court, and in 2022, in which a mortgage defaulter questioned the legitimacy of the court, a case which his financial provider won.\nBen Gilroy took numerous court cases in the 2010s against several Irish banks and has represented people facing house repossessions. In 2018, he was banned by the High Court from taking further court cases against Allied Irish Banks and from advising others before the courts due to his history of bringing forward frivolous and vexatious litigation.

He was fined A$150 after he argued that police had no power to charge him or commence proceedings before the court. Bradley appealed to the Queensland District Court (QDC), arguing that he was a \"sovereign citizen\" and the laws of Queensland did not apply to him. Bradley sought leave to appeal the order made by the QDC to dismiss his appeal of the Magistrates Court decision to the Queensland Court of Appeal (QCA). At the QCA, President Sofronoff noted that, given his sovereign citizen arguments it was difficult to understand why Bradley was \"agitating his claims before this court, one which was established under the laws he says do not apply to him\". The judge noted that the \"paradox was apparently lost\" on the applicant and dismissed the appeal.\n\n\n== Professional advisories ==\nLawyers and notaries in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, have been warned by their professional bodies about dealing with freemen as clients.

        "title": "Ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic",
        "wikipedia_content": "Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that is well established for use in animals and people. The World Health Organization (WHO), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) all advise against using ivermectin in an attempt to treat or prevent COVID-19.\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19. Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public. While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts. Some people, desperate to use ivermectin without a prescription, took veterinary preparations, which led to shortages of supplies of ivermectin for animal treatment. The FDA responded to this situation by saying “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, ya’ll. Stop it,”  in a tweet to draw attention to the issue, for which they were later sued by three ivermectin-prescribing doctors.\nSubsequent research failed to confirm the utility of ivermectin for COVID-19, and in 2021 it emerged that many of the studies demonstrating benefit were faulty, misleading, or fraudulent. Nevertheless, misinformation about ivermectin continued to be propagated on social media and the drug remained a cause célèbre for anti-vaccinationists and conspiracy theorists.\n\n\n== Research ==\nSome in vitro drug screening studies early in the pandemic showed that ivermectin has antiviral effects against several distinct positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent studies found that ivermectin could inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey kidney cell culture with an IC50 of 2.2–2.8 μM.\nHowever, doses much higher than the maximum approved or safely achievable for use in humans would be required for an antiviral effect while treating COVID-19. Aside from practical difficulties, such high doses are not covered by current human-use approvals of the drug and may be toxic, as the antiviral mechanism of action is believed to be via the suppression of a host cellular process, specifically the inhibition of nuclear transport by importin α/β1. Several other drugs which inhibit importin α/β1 at therapeutic doses have failed clinical trials due to systemic toxicity and a narrow therapeutic window.\nTo resolve uncertainties from previous small or poor-quality studies, as of June 2021, large scale trials were underway in the United States and the United Kingdom. A large randomised controlled trial ACTIV-6, published in October 2022, found ivermectin was not effective as a COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\n=== Research limitations, ethics and fraud ===\nMany studies on ivermectin for COVID‑19 have serious methodological limitations, resulting in very low evidence certainty. Several publications that supported the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID‑19 have been retracted due to errors, unverifiable data, and ethical concerns.\nSeveral high-profile publications purporting to demonstrate reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients were later retracted due to suspected data falsification. This only added to confusion among the media and lay public, as these publications had been widely cited by ivermectin supporters and included in meta-analyses.\nIn January 2022, 22 inmates at the Washington County Detention Center in Arkansas filed a lawsuit over hundreds of ivermectin pills given to them as \"vitamins\" in 2020.\nIn February 2022, the American Journal of Therapeutics issued expressions of concern against two positive systematic reviews of ivermectin for COVID-19 which it had published in 2021, because of suspicions about the underlying data that would undermine these papers' findings of benefit.\nIn Mexico City the government distributed ivermectin widely as a COVID-19 treatment and published the observed results on the SocArXiv archive as a research paper. The paper was subsequently withdrawn by the archive citing concerns that it was unethical, as it effectively was an experiment carried out on people without gaining informed consent. Philip N. Cohen of the SocArXiv steering committee said \"the article is of very poor quality or deliberately false and misleading\" and that its removal was justified to prevent public harm.\n\n\n== Clinical guidance ==\nIn February 2021, Merck, the developer of the drug, issued a statement saying that there is no good evidence ivermectin is effective against COVID‑19 and that attempting such use may be unsafe.\nAfter reviewing the evidence on ivermectin, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) advised against its use for prevention or treatment of COVID‑19 and that \"the available data do not support its use for COVID‑19 outside well-designed clinical trials.\" Consequently, ivermectin is not authorized for use to treat COVID‑19 within the European Union.\nIvermectin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating any viral illness, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health COVID‑19 Treatment Guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence for ivermectin to allow for a recommendation for or against its use.\nIn the United Kingdom, the national COVID‑19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel determined that the evidence base and plausibility of ivermectin as a COVID‑19 treatment were insufficient to pursue further investigations.\nIn November 2023, the WHO updated its treatment guidelines to recommend strongly against the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, due to a lack of research evidence or biological plausibility.\nThe Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, and Brazilian Thoracic Society issued position statements advising against the use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of early-stage COVID‑19.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 and strongyloidiasis ===\nThere is one very specific circumstance in which ivermectin may be useful in the management of COVID-19. People infected with the Strongyloides stercoralis parasite are at risk for strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome (SHS) —  a condition with a mortality rate as high as 90% — if given corticosteroids to treat COVID-19. Strongyloidiasis affects as many as 370 million people worldwide, and it is usually subclinical or even asymptomatic. However, it can become fatal in the setting of SHS, which can be triggered by the immunosuppression that results from the administration of corticosteroids. In fact, multiple cases of SHS have been reported after the use of corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all recommend presumptive treatment for strongyloidiasis with ivermectin in people at high or moderate risk of SHS before or in conjunction with corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19. People who were born, resided, or had long-term travel in Southeast Asia, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, or the Caribbean are considered to be at high risk for SHS, while people from Central America, Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Mexico, Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent are considered to be at moderate risk. In such cases, ivermectin is a treatment for strongyloidiasis, not for COVID-19.\n\n\n== Regulatory status and off-label use ==\nMisinformation, lower degrees of trust, and a sense of despair over increasing case and death counts have led to an increase in ivermectin's use in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and South Africa. A black market has also developed in many of these countries where official approval has not been granted.\nThe viral social media misinformation about ivermectin has gained particular attention in South Africa where an anti-vaccination group called \"South Africa Has A Right To Ivermectin\" has been lobbying for the drug to be made available for prescription. Another group, the \"Ivermectin Interest Group\" launched a court case against the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), and as a result a compassionate use exemption was granted. SAHPRA stated in April 2021 that \"At present, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 infections.\" In September 2021, SAHPRA repeated warnings against fake news and misinformation and took up the FDA's stance about ivermectin. Due to lacking evidence of efficacy and growing body of retracted pro-ivermectin papers, SAHPRA revoked the compassionate use program in May 2022.\nDespite the absence of high-quality evidence to suggest any efficacy and advice to the contrary, some governments have allowed its off-label use for the prevention and treatment of COVID‑19. Countries that have granted such official approval for ivermectin include the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Mexico, Peru (later rescinded), India (later rescinded), and the Philippines. Cities that have launched campaigns of massive distribution of ivermectin include Cali, Colombia; and Itajai, Brazil.\nIn Arkansas in 2021, a prison doctor prescribed ivermectin for inmates without their consent. A legal action brought on the inmates' behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was settled with the prison authorities paying compensation. The ACLU said the outcome was \"victory for civil rights and medical ethics\".\nIvermectin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating any viral illness and is not authorized for use to treat COVID-19 within the European Union. After reviewing the evidence on ivermectin, the EMA said that \"the available data do not support its use for COVID-19 outside well-designed clinical trials\". The World Health Organization also said that ivermectin should not be used to treat COVID-19 except in a clinical trial. The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, and Brazilian Thoracic Society issued position statements advising against the use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of early-stage COVID-19.\nSeveral Latin American government health organizations recommended ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment based, in part, on preprints and anecdotal evidence; these recommendations were later denounced by the Pan American Health Organization.\nIn the United States, an analysis of prescribing data suggested the influence of political affiliation, as Republican-voting areas saw a pronounced surge in ivermectin (and hydroxychloroquine) prescription in 2020.\n\n\n=== Human use of veterinary products ===\n\nAs people began using veterinary preparations of ivermectin for personal use stocks began to decline, requiring vendors to ration their sales and raise prices. In the United States supplies of horse dewormer paste began to run low as people used it for themselves; some vendors required their customers to show a picture of themselves and their horses together, to provide assurance they were purchasing the paste for animal use.\nIn August 2021 the CDC issued a health alert prompted by a sharp rise in calls to poison control centres about ivermectin poisoning. The CDC described two cases requiring hospitalization; in one, a person had drunk an injectable ivermectin product intended for use in cattle.\nIn August 2021, the FDA tweeted \"You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it\". Following a legal challenge from ivermectin-prescribing doctors, in August 2023 a US court found the FDA had exceeded its authority by posting the tweet, which they said amounted to medical advice, and that doctors could prescribe whatever they wanted. Remarks made during the legal proceedings were misrepresented on social media to claim that the FDA had somehow reversed its position on ivermectin and COVID-19, which in reality remained unchanged. In March 2024 the FDA settled outstanding litigation and removed all social media posts that could be construed as giving medical advice and thus exceeding its statutory authority, while re-iterating that its position remained unchanged and that \"currently available clinical trial data do not demonstrate that ivermectin is effective against COVID-19\".\n\n\n== Intellectual property and economics ==\nAs the patent on ivermectin has expired, generic drug manufacturers have been able to enjoy significantly increased revenue prompted by the spike in demand. One Brazilian company, Vitamedic Industria Farmaceutica, saw its annual revenue from ivermectin sales increase to $85 million in 2020, a more than fivefold increase.\nIn Australia in 2020 Thomas Borody, a professor and gastroenterologist, announced that he had discovered a \"cure\" for COVID-19: a combination of ivermectin, doxycycline and zinc. In a media interview Borody stated \"The biggest thing about this is no one will make money from this\". It later emerged that Topelia Australia, Borody's company, had filed a patent for the drug combination. Borody was accused of not adequately disclosing his conflict of interest.\nIn October 2021 a large network of companies selling hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin was disclosed in the US, targeting primarily right-wing and vaccine-hesitant groups through social media and conspiracy videos by anti-vaccine activists such as Simone Gold. The network had 72,000 customers who collectively paid $15 million for consultations and medications.\n\n\n== Misinformation and advocacy ==\nIvermectin became a cause célèbre for right-wing figures promoting it as a supposed COVID treatment. Misinformation about ivermectin's efficacy spread widely on social media, fueled by publications that have since been retracted, misleading \"meta-analysis\" websites with substandard methods, and conspiracy theories about efforts by governments and scientists to \"suppress the evidence.\"\n\n\n=== Social media advocacy ===\nIvermectin has been championed by a number of social media influencers.\n\nAmerican podcaster and author Bret Weinstein took ivermectin during a livestream video and said both he and his wife Heather Heying had not been vaccinated because of their fears concerning COVID-19 vaccines. In response, YouTube demonetized the channel.\nIn the United Kingdom, retired nurse educator and YouTuber John Campbell has posted videos carrying false claims about the use of ivermectin in Japan as a possible cause of a \"miracle\" decline in cases. In reality, there is no evidence of ivermectin use in Japan and it is not approved as a COVID-19 treatment. In February 2022, reports also appeared falsely claiming that the Japanese company Kowa had been able to evidence the efficacy of ivermectin in a phase III trial.\n\n\n=== Misleading meta-analysis websites ===\nDuring the pandemic, several misleading websites appeared purporting to show meta-analyses of clinical evidence in favor of ivermectin's use in treating COVID-19. The sites in question had anonymous owners, multiple domains which redirected to the same content, and used many colourful, but misleading, graphics to communicate their point. The web servers used for these sites are the same as those previously used to spread misinformation about hydroxychloroquine.\nWhile these sites gained traction among many non-scientists on social media, they also violated many of the basic norms of meta-analysis methodology. Notably, many of these sites included studies with widely different dosages of the treatment, an open-label design (in which experimenters and participants both know who is in the control group), poor-quality control groups (such as another untested treatment which may worsen outcomes), or no control group at all. Another issue is the inclusion of multiple ad-hoc unpublished trials which did not undergo peer-review, and which had different incompatible outcome measures. Such methodological problems are known to distort the findings of meta-analyses and cause spurious or false findings. The misinformation communicated by these sites created confusion among the public and policymakers.\n\n\n=== Fake endorsements ===\n\nOn Twitter, a tweet spread with a photograph of William C. Campbell, the co-inventor of ivermectin, alongside a fabricated quotation saying that he endorsed ivermectin as a COVID treatment. Campbell reacted by saying \"I utterly despise and deny the remarks attributed to me on social media\" adding that his field of expertise was not virology so he would never comment in such a way.\nIn February 2022 a report was broadcast by Australia's Nine Network about Queen Elizabeth II having COVID-19. The segment featured Mukesh Haikerwal and included an intercut image of a box of ivermectin tablets, leading antivaxxers to spread the idea via social media that ivermectin was being specially used, as a \"treatment fit for a queen\". Haikerwal stated that he rejected ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, and the network issued an apology to him, saying the ivermectin image has been included \"as a result of human error\".\n\n\n=== Scientists targeted ===\nIn July 2021 Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at Liverpool University, published a meta-analysis of ivermectin use for COVID which suggested it may be beneficial. However, as research fraud subsequently emerged in some studies included in the meta-analysis, Hill revised his analysis to discount the suspect evidence, and found the apparent success of ivermectin evaporated as a result. Writing for The Guardian, Hill recounted how the revision led to him being attacked on social media as being supposedly in the pay of Bill Gates, and how he was sent photos of coffins and hanged nazis.\nEpidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz has identified ivermectin as being one of the most politicized topics in the pandemic, alongside vaccination. Meyerowitz-Katz has used social media to publicize flaws in ivermectin research and as a result, he says, has received more death threats than for any other topic he has engaged with.\n\n\n=== Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance ===\nIn December 2020, the chair of the US Senate Homeland Security Committee, Ron Johnson, used a Senate hearing to promote fringe theories about, and unproven treatments for, COVID-19, including ivermectin. Among the witnesses was Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care doctor, who erroneously described ivermectin as \"miraculous\" and a \"wonder drug\" to be used against COVID-19. Video footage of his statements went viral on social media, receiving over one million views as of 11 December 2020.\nIn the United States, the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 is championed by an organization led by Kory called Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which promotes \"the global movement to move #Ivermectin into the mainstream\". The effort went viral on social media, where it was adopted by COVID deniers, anti-vaccination proponents, and conspiracy theorists. A review article by FLCCC members on the efficacy of ivermectin, which had been provisionally accepted by a Frontiers in Pharmacology, was subsequently rejected on account of what the publisher called \"a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance\" meaning that the article did \"not offer an objective [or] balanced scientific contribution to the evaluation of ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19\". David Gorski wrote that the narrative of ivermectin as a \"miracle cure\" for COVID-19 is a \"metastasized\" version of a similar conspiracy theory around the drug hydroxychloroquine, in which unspecified powers are thought to be suppressing news of the drug's effectiveness for their own profit.\n\n\n=== Pfizer's drug development ===\nConspiracy theorists on the internet have claimed that Pfizer's anti-COVID-19 drug paxlovid is merely \"repackaged ivermectin\". Their claims are based on a narrative that Pfizer is suppressing the true benefits of ivermectin and rely on superficial correspondences between the drugs and a misunderstanding of their respective pharmokinetics. Paxlovid is a combination drug of two small-molecule antiviral compounds (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) which have no connection to ivermectin.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe widespread misconduct found in ivermectin/COVID-19 research has prompted introspection within the scientific community.\nAustralian epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz wrote, \"There are no two ways about it: Science is flawed\". Meyerowitz-Katz estimates that as of December 2021, credence in flawed research had led to ivermectin being perhaps the most used medication worldwide during the pandemic and that the scale of the problem suggested a radical rethink was needed of how medical research was assessed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBig Pharma conspiracy theories\nCOVID-19 drug repurposing research\nCOVID-19 misinformation\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship contends that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays and poems of William Shakespeare. While historians and literary scholars overwhelmingly reject alternative authorship candidates, including Oxford, public interest in the Oxfordian theory continues. After the 1920s, the Oxfordian theory became the most popular alternative Shakespeare authorship theory.\nThe convergence of documentary evidence of the type used by academics for authorial attribution – title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records – sufficiently establishes Shakespeare's authorship for the overwhelming majority of Shakespeare scholars and literary historians, and no such documentary evidence links Oxford to Shakespeare's works. Oxfordians, however, reject the historical record and claim that circumstantial evidence supports Oxford’s authorship, proposing that the contradictory historical evidence is part of a conspiracy that falsified the record to protect the identity of the real author. Scholarly literary specialists consider the Oxfordian method of interpreting the plays and poems as grounded in an autobiographical fallacy, and argue that using his works to infer and construct a hypothetical author's biography is both unreliable and logically unsound.\nOxfordian arguments rely heavily on biographical allusions; adherents find correspondences between incidents and circumstances in Oxford's life and events in Shakespeare's plays, sonnets, and longer poems. The case also relies on perceived parallels of language, idiom, and thought between Shakespeare's works and Oxford's own poetry and letters. Oxfordians claim that marked passages in Oxford's Bible can be linked to Biblical allusions in Shakespeare's plays. That no plays survive under Oxford's name is also important to the Oxfordian theory. Oxfordians interpret certain 16th- and 17th-century literary allusions as indicating that Oxford was one of the more prominent suppressed anonymous and/or pseudonymous writers of the day. Under this scenario, Shakespeare was either a \"front man\" or \"play-broker\" who published the plays under his own name or was merely an actor with a similar name, misidentified as the playwright since the first Shakespeare biographies of the early 1700s.\nThe most compelling evidence against the Oxfordian theory is de Vere's death in 1604, since the generally accepted chronology of Shakespeare's plays places the composition of approximately twelve of the plays after that date. Oxfordians respond that the annual publication of \"new\" or \"corrected\" Shakespeare plays stopped in 1604, and that the dedication to Shakespeare's Sonnets implies that the author was dead prior to their publication in 1609. Oxfordians believe the reason so many of the \"late plays\" show evidence of revision and collaboration is because they were completed by other playwrights after Oxford's death.\n\n\n== History of the Oxfordian theory ==\nThe theory that the works of Shakespeare were in fact written by someone other than William Shakespeare dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. In 1857, the first book on the topic, The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded, by Delia Bacon, was published. Bacon proposed the first \"group theory\" of Shakespearian authorship, attributing the works to a committee headed by Francis Bacon and including Walter Raleigh. De Vere is mentioned once in the book, in a list of \"high-born wits and poets\", who were associated with Raleigh. Some commentators have interpreted this to imply that he was part of the group of authors. Throughout the 19th century Bacon was the preferred hidden author. Oxford is not known to have been mentioned again in this context.\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century other candidates, typically aristocrats, were put forward, most notably Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Oxford's candidacy as sole author was first proposed by J. Thomas Looney in his 1920 book Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Following earlier anti-Stratfordians, Looney argued that the known facts of Shakespeare's life did not fit the personality he ascribed to the author of the plays. Like other anti-Stratfordians before him, Looney referred to the absence of records concerning Shakespeare's education, his limited experience of the world, his allegedly poor handwriting skills (evidenced in his signatures), and the \"dirt and ignorance\" of Stratford at the time. Shakespeare had a petty \"acquisitive disposition\", he said, while the plays made heroes of free-spending figures. They also portrayed middle and lower-class people negatively, while Shakespearian heroes were typically aristocratic. Looney referred to scholars who found in the plays evidence that their author was an expert in law, widely read in ancient Latin literature, and could speak French and Italian. Looney believed that even very early works such as Love's Labour's Lost implied that he was already a person of \"matured powers\", in his forties or fifties, with wide experience of the world. Looney considered that Oxford's personality fitted the one he deduced from the plays, and he also identified characters in the plays as detailed portraits of Oxford's family and personal contacts. Several characters, including Hamlet and Bertram (in All's Well that Ends Well), were, he believed, self-portraits. Adapting arguments earlier used for Rutland and Derby, Looney fitted events in the plays to episodes in Oxford's life, including his travels to France and Italy, the settings for many plays. Oxford's death in 1604 was linked to a drop-off in the publication of Shakespeare plays. Looney declared that the late play The Tempest was not written by Oxford, and that others performed or published after Oxford's death were most probably left incomplete and finished by other writers, thus explaining the apparent idiosyncrasies of style found in the late Shakespeare plays. Looney also introduced the argument that the reference to the \"ever-living poet\" in the 1609 dedication to Shakespeare's sonnets implied that the author was dead at the time of publication.\n\nSigmund Freud, the novelist Marjorie Bowen, and several 20th-century celebrities found the thesis persuasive, and Oxford soon overtook Bacon as the favoured alternative candidate to Shakespeare, though academic Shakespearians mostly ignored the subject. Looney's theory attracted a number of activist followers who published books supplementing his own and added new arguments, most notably Percy Allen, Bernard M. Ward, Louis P. Bénézet and Charles Wisner Barrell. Mainstream scholar Steven W. May has noted that Oxfordians of this period made genuine contributions to knowledge of Elizabethan history, citing \"Ward's quite competent biography of the Earl\" and \"Charles Wisner Barrell's identification of Edward Vere, Oxford's illegitimate son by Anne Vavasour\" as examples. In 1921, Sir George Greenwood, Looney, and others founded The Shakespeare Fellowship, an organization originally dedicated to the discussion and promotion of ecumenical anti-Stratfordian views, but which later became devoted to promoting Oxford as the true Shakespeare.\n\n\n=== Decline and revival ===\nAfter a period of decline of the Oxfordian theory beginning with World War II, in 1952 Dorothy and Charlton Greenwood Ogburn published the 1,300-page This Star of England, which briefly revived Oxfordism. A series of critical academic books and articles, however, held in check any appreciable growth of anti-Stratfordism and Oxfordism, most notably The Shakespeare Ciphers Examined (1957), by William and Elizebeth Friedman, The Poacher from Stratford (1958), by Frank Wadsworth, Shakespeare and His Betters (1958), by Reginald Churchill, The Shakespeare Claimants (1962), by H. N. Gibson, and Shakespeare and his Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy (1962), by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn. By 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that \"the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb, dormant, or non-existent\". In 1974, membership in the society stood at 80. In 1979, the publication of an analysis of the Ashbourne portrait dealt a further blow to the movement. The painting, long claimed to be one of the portraits of Shakespeare, but considered by Barrell to be an overpaint of a portrait of the Earl of Oxford, turned out to represent neither, but rather depicted Hugh Hamersley.\nCharlton Ogburn Jr., was elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976 and kick-started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by seeking publicity through moot court trials, media debates, television and later the Internet, including Wikipedia, methods which became standard for Oxfordian and anti-Stratfordian promoters because of their success in recruiting members of the lay public. He portrayed academic scholars as self-interested members of an \"entrenched authority\" that aimed to \"outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society\", and proposed to counter their influence by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare.\nIn 1985 Ogburn published his 900-page The Mysterious William Shakespeare: the Myth and the Reality, with a Foreword by Pulitzer prize-winning historian David McCullough who wrote: \"[T]his brilliant, powerful book is a major event for everyone who cares about Shakespeare. The scholarship is surpassing—brave, original, full of surprise... The strange, difficult, contradictory man who emerges as the real Shakespeare, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, is not just plausible but fascinating and wholly believable.\"\nBy framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after Watergate, he used the media to circumnavigate academia and appeal directly to the public. Ogburn's efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate.\nAlthough Shakespearian experts disparaged Ogburn's methodology and his conclusions, one reviewer, Richmond Crinkley, the Folger Shakespeare Library's former director of educational programs, acknowledged the appeal of Ogburn's approach, writing that the doubts over Shakespeare, \"arising early and growing rapidly\", have a \"simple, direct plausibility\", and the dismissive attitude of established scholars only worked to encourage such doubts. Though Crinkley rejected Ogburn's thesis, calling it \"less satisfactory than the unsatisfactory orthodoxy it challenges\", he believed that one merit of the book lay in how it forces orthodox scholars to reexamine their concept of Shakespeare as author. Spurred by Ogburn's book, \"[i]n the last decade of the twentieth century members of the Oxfordian camp gathered strength and made a fresh assault on the Shakespearean citadel, hoping finally to unseat the man from Stratford and install de Vere in his place.\"\nThe Oxfordian theory returned to public attention in anticipation of the late October 2011 release of Roland Emmerich's drama film Anonymous. Its distributor, Sony Pictures, advertised that the film \"presents a compelling portrait of Edward de Vere as the true author of Shakespeare's plays\", and commissioned high school and college-level lesson plans to promote the authorship question to history and literature teachers across the United States. According to Sony Pictures, \"the objective for our Anonymous program, as stated in the classroom literature, is 'to encourage critical thinking by challenging students to examine the theories about the authorship of Shakespeare's works and to formulate their own opinions.' The study guide does not state that Edward de Vere is the writer of Shakespeare's work, but it does pose the authorship question which has been debated by scholars for decades\".\n\n\n== Variant Oxfordian theories ==\nAlthough most Oxfordians agree on the main arguments for Oxford, the theory has spawned schismatic variants that have not met with wide acceptance by all Oxfordians, although they have gained much attention.\n\n\n=== Prince Tudor theory ===\n\nIn a letter written by Looney in 1933, he mentions that Allen and Ward were \"advancing certain views respecting Oxford and Queen Eliz. which appear to me extravagant & improbable, in no way strengthen Oxford’s Shakespeare claims, and are likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule.\" Allen and Ward believed that they had discovered that Elizabeth and Oxford were lovers and had conceived a child. Allen developed the theory in his 1934 book Anne Cecil, Elizabeth & Oxford. He argued that the child was given the name William Hughes, who became an actor under the stage-name \"William Shakespeare\". He adopted the name because his father, Oxford, was already using it as a pen-name for his plays. Oxford had borrowed the name from a third Shakespeare, the man of that name from Stratford-upon-Avon, who was a law student at the time, but who was never an actor or a writer. Allen later changed his mind about Hughes and decided that the concealed child was the Earl of Southampton, the dedicatee of Shakespeare's narrative poems. This secret history, which has become known as the Prince Tudor theory, was covertly represented in Oxford's plays and poems and remained hidden until Allen and Ward's discoveries. The narrative poems and sonnets had been written by Oxford for his son. This Star of England (1952) by Charlton and Dorothy Ogburn included arguments in support of this version of the theory. Their son, Charlton Ogburn Jr, agreed with Looney that the theory was an impediment to the Oxfordian movement and omitted all discussion about it in his own Oxfordian works.\nHowever, the theory was revived and expanded by Elisabeth Sears in Shakespeare and the Tudor Rose (2002), and Hank Whittemore in The Monument (2005), an analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets which interprets the poems as a poetic history of Queen Elizabeth, Oxford, and Southampton. Paul Streitz's Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I (2001) advances a variation on the theory: that Oxford himself was the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth by her stepfather, Thomas Seymour. Oxford was thus the half-brother of his own son by the queen. Streitz also believes that the queen had children by the Earl of Leicester. These were Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, Mary Sidney and Elizabeth Leighton.\n\n\n=== Attribution of other works to Oxford ===\nAs with other candidates for authorship of Shakespeare's works, Oxford's advocates have attributed numerous non-Shakespearian works to him. Looney began the process in his 1921 edition of de Vere's poetry. He suggested that de Vere was also responsible for some of the literary works credited to Arthur Golding, Anthony Munday and John Lyly. Streitz credits Oxford with the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Two professors of linguistics have claimed that de Vere wrote not only the works of Shakespeare, but most of what is memorable in English literature during his lifetime, with such names as Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, Philip Sidney, John Lyly, George Peele, George Gascoigne, Raphael Holinshed, Robert Greene, Thomas Phaer, and Arthur Golding being among dozens of further pseudonyms of de Vere. Ramon Jiménez has credited Oxford with such plays as The True Tragedy of Richard III and Edmund Ironside.\n\n\n=== Group theories ===\nGroup theories in which Oxford played the principal role as writer, but collaborated with others to create the Shakespeare canon, were adopted by a number of early Oxfordians. Looney himself was willing to concede that Oxford may have been assisted by his son-in-law William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, who perhaps wrote The Tempest. B. M. Ward also suggested that Oxford and Derby worked together. In his later writings Percy Allen argued that Oxford led a group of writers, among whom was William Shakespeare. Group theories with Oxford as the principal author or creative \"master mind\" were also proposed by Gilbert Standen in Shakespeare Authorship (1930), Gilbert Slater in Seven Shakespeares (1931) and Montagu William Douglas in Lord Oxford and the Shakespeare Group (1952).\n\n\n== Case against Oxfordian theory ==\n\n\n=== Methodology of Oxfordian argument ===\n\nSpecialists in Elizabethan literary history object to the methodology of Oxfordian arguments. In lieu of any evidence of the type commonly used for authorship attribution, Oxfordians discard the methods used by historians and employ other types of arguments to make their case, the most common being supposed parallels between Oxford's life and Shakespeare's works.\nAnother is finding cryptic allusions to Oxford's supposed play writing in other literary works of the era that to them suggest that his authorship was obvious to those \"in the know\". David Kathman writes that their methods are subjective and devoid of any evidential value, because they use a \"double standard\". Their arguments are \"not taken seriously by Shakespeare scholars because they consistently distort and misrepresent the historical record\", \"neglect to provide necessary context\" and are in some cases \"outright fabrication[s]\". One major evidential objection to the Oxfordian theory is Edward de Vere's 1604 death, after which a number of Shakespeare's plays are generally believed to have been written. In The Shakespeare Claimants, a 1962 examination of the authorship question, H. N. Gibson concluded that \"... on analysis the Oxfordian case appears to me a very weak one\".\n\n\n=== Mainstream objections ===\nMainstream academics have often argued that the Oxford theory is based on snobbery: that anti-Stratfordians reject the idea that the son of a mere tradesman could write the plays and poems of Shakespeare. The Shakespeare Oxford Society has responded that this claim is \"a substitute for reasoned responses to Oxfordian evidence and logic\" and is merely an ad hominem attack.\nMainstream critics further say that, if William Shakespeare were a fraud instead of the true author, the number of people involved in suppressing this information would have made it highly unlikely to succeed. And citing the \"testimony of contemporary writers, court records and much else\" supporting Shakespeare's authorship, Columbia University professor James S. Shapiro says any theory claiming that \"there must have been a conspiracy to suppress the truth of de Vere's authorship\" based on the idea that \"the very absence of surviving evidence proves the case\" is a logically fatal tautology.\n\n\n== Circumstantial evidence ==\n\nWhile no documentary evidence connects Oxford (or any alternative author) to the plays of Shakespeare, Oxfordian writers, including Mark Anderson and Charlton Ogburn, say that connection is made by considerable circumstantial evidence inferred from Oxford's connections to the Elizabethan theatre and poetry scene; the participation of his family in the printing and publication of the First Folio; his relationship with the Earl of Southampton (believed by most Shakespeare scholars to have been Shakespeare's patron); as well as a number of specific incidents and circumstances of Oxford's life that Oxfordians say are depicted in the plays themselves.\n\n\n=== Theatre connections ===\nOxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage, garnering dedications from a wide range of authors. For much of his adult life, Oxford patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as performances by musicians, acrobats and performing animals, and in 1583, he was a leaseholder of the first Blackfriars Theatre in London.\n\n\n=== Family connections ===\nOxford was related to several literary figures. His mother, Margory Golding, was the sister of the Ovid translator Arthur Golding, and his uncle, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was the inventor of the English or Shakespearian sonnet form.\nThe three dedicatees of Shakespeare's works (the earls of Southampton, Montgomery and Pembroke) were each proposed as husbands for the three daughters of Edward de Vere. Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece were dedicated to Southampton (whom many scholars have argued was the Fair Youth of the Sonnets), and the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays was dedicated to Montgomery (who married Susan de Vere) and Pembroke (who was once engaged to Bridget de Vere).\n\n\n=== Oxford's Bible ===\nIn the late 1990s, Roger A. Stritmatter conducted a study of the marked passages found in Edward de Vere's Geneva Bible, which is now owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library. The Bible contains 1,028 instances of underlined words or passages and a few hand-written annotations, most of which consist of a single word or fragment. Stritmatter believes about a quarter of the marked passages appear in Shakespeare's works as either a theme, allusion, or quotation. Stritmatter grouped the marked passages into eight themes. Arguing that the themes fitted de Vere's known interests, he proceeded to link specific themes to passages in Shakespeare. Critics have doubted that any of the underlinings or annotations in the Bible can be reliably attributed to de Vere and not the book's other owners prior to its acquisition by the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1925, as well as challenging the looseness of Stritmatter's standards for a Biblical allusion in Shakespeare's works and arguing that there is no statistical significance to the overlap.\n\n\n=== Stratford connections ===\nShakespeare's native Avon and Stratford are referred to in two prefatory poems in the 1623 First Folio, one of which refers to Shakespeare as \"Swan of Avon\" and another to the author's \"Stratford monument\". Oxfordians say the first of these phrases could refer to one of Edward de Vere's manors, Bilton Hall, near the Forest of Arden, in Rugby, on the River Avon. This view was first expressed by Charles Wisner Barrell, who argued that De Vere \"kept the place as a literary hideaway where he could carry on his creative work without the interference of his father-in-law, Burghley, and other distractions of Court and city life.\" Oxfordians also consider it significant that the nearest town to the parish of Hackney, where de Vere later lived and was buried, was also named Stratford. Mainstream scholar Irvin Matus demonstrated that Oxford sold the Bilton house in 1580, having previously rented it out, making it unlikely that Ben Jonson's 1623 poem would identify Oxford by referring to a property he once owned, but never lived in, and sold 43 years earlier. Nor is there any evidence of a monument to Oxford in Stratford, London, or anywhere else; his widow provided for the creation of one at Hackney in her 1613 will, but there is no evidence that it was ever erected.\n\n\n=== Oxford's annuity ===\nOxfordians also believe that Rev. Dr. John Ward's 1662 diary entry stating that Shakespeare wrote two plays a year \"and for that had an allowance so large that he spent at the rate of £1,000 a year\" as a critical piece of evidence, since Queen Elizabeth I gave Oxford an annuity of exactly £1,000 beginning in 1586 that was continued until his death. Ogburn wrote that the annuity was granted \"under mysterious circumstances\", and Anderson suggests it was granted because of Oxford's writing patriotic plays for government propaganda. However, the documentary evidence indicates that the allowance was meant to relieve Oxford's embarrassed financial situation caused by the ruination of his estate.\n\n\n=== Oxford's travels and the settings of Shakespeare's plays ===\nAlmost half of Shakespeare's plays are set in Italy, many of them containing details of Italian laws, customs, and culture which Oxfordians believe could only have been obtained by personal experiences in Italy, and especially in Venice. The author of The Merchant of Venice, Looney believed, \"knew Italy first hand and was touched with the life and spirit of the country\". This argument had earlier been used by supporters of the Earl of Rutland and the Earl of Derby as authorship candidates, both of whom had also travelled on the continent of Europe. Oxfordian William Farina refers to Shakespeare's apparent knowledge of the Jewish ghetto, Venetian architecture and laws in The Merchant of Venice, especially the city's \"notorious Alien Statute\". Historical documents confirm that Oxford lived in Venice, and travelled for over a year through Italy. He disliked the country, writing in a letter to Lord Burghley dated 24 September 1575, \"I am glad I have seen it, and I care not ever to see it any more\". Still, he remained in Italy for another six months, leaving Venice in March 1576. According to Anderson, Oxford definitely visited Venice, Padua, Milan, Genoa, Palermo, Florence, Siena and Naples, and probably passed through Messina, Mantua and Verona, all cities used as settings by Shakespeare. In testimony before the Venetian Inquisition, Edward de Vere was said to be fluent in Italian.\nHowever, some Shakespeare scholars say that Shakespeare gets many details of Italian life wrong, including the laws and urban geography of Venice. Kenneth Gross writes that \"the play itself knows nothing about the Venetian ghetto; we get no sense of a legally separate region of Venice where Shylock must dwell.\" Scott McCrea describes the setting as \"a nonrealistic Venice\" and the laws invoked by Portia as part of the \"imaginary world of the play\", inconsistent with actual legal practice. Charles Ross points out that Shakespeare's Alien Statute bears little resemblance to any Italian law. For later plays such as Othello, Shakespeare probably used Lewes Lewknor's 1599 English translation of Gasparo Contarini's The Commonwealth and Government of Venice for some details about Venice's laws and customs.\nShakespeare derived much of this material from John Florio, an Italian scholar living in England who was later thanked by Ben Jonson for helping him get Italian details right for his play Volpone. Keir Elam has traced Shakespeare's Italian idioms in Shrew and some of the dialogue to Florio's Second Fruits, a bilingual introduction to Italian language and culture published in 1591. Jason Lawrence believes that Shakespeare’s Italian dialogue in the play derives \"almost entirely\" from Florio’s First Fruits (1578). He also believes that Shakespeare became more proficient in reading the language as set out in Florio’s manuals, as evidenced by his increasing use of Florio and other Italian sources for writing the plays.\n\n\n=== Oxford's education and knowledge of court life ===\nIn 1567 Oxford was admitted to Gray's Inn, one of the Inns of Court which Justice Shallow reminisces about in Henry IV, Part 2. Sobran observes that the Sonnets \"abound not only in legal terms – more than 200 – but also in elaborate legal conceits.\" These terms include: allege, auditor, defects, exchequer, forfeit, heirs, impeach, lease, moiety, recompense, render, sureties, and usage. Shakespeare also uses the legal term \"quietus\" (final settlement) in Sonnet 134, the last Fair Youth sonnet.\nRegarding Oxford's knowledge of court life, which Oxfordians believe is reflected throughout the plays, mainstream scholars say that any special knowledge of the aristocracy appearing in the plays can be more easily explained by Shakespeare's life-time of performances before nobility and royalty, and possibly, as Gibson theorises, \"by visits to his patron's house, as Marlowe visited Walsingham.\"\n\n\n== Oxford's literary reputation ==\n\n\n=== Oxford's lyric poetry ===\nSome of Oxford's lyric works have survived. Steven W. May, an authority on Oxford's poetry, attributes sixteen poems definitely, and four possibly, to Oxford noting that these are probably \"only a good sampling\" as \"both Webbe (1586) and Puttenham (1589) rank him first among the courtier poets, an eminence he probably would not have been granted, despite his reputation as a patron, by virtue of a mere handful of lyrics\".\nMay describes Oxford as a \"competent, fairly experimental poet working in the established modes of mid-century lyric verse\" and his poetry as \"examples of the standard varieties of mid-Elizabethan amorous lyric\". In 2004, May wrote that Oxford's poetry was \"one man's contribution to the rhetorical mainstream of an evolving Elizabethan poetic\" and challenged readers to distinguish any of it from \"the output of his mediocre mid-century contemporaries\". C. S. Lewis wrote that de Vere's poetry shows \"a faint talent\", but is \"for the most part undistinguished and verbose.\"\n\n\n==== Comparisons to Shakespeare's work ====\nIn the opinion of J. Thomas Looney, as \"far as forms of versification are concerned De Vere presents just that rich variety which is so noticeable in Shakespeare; and almost all the forms he employs we find reproduced in the Shakespeare work.\" Oxfordian Louis P. Bénézet created the \"Bénézet test\", a collage of lines from Shakespeare and lines he thought were representative of Oxford, challenging non-specialists to tell the difference between the two authors. May notes that Looney compared various motifs, rhetorical devices and phrases with certain Shakespeare works to find similarities he said were \"the most crucial in the piecing together of the case\", but that  for some of those \"crucial\" examples Looney used six poems mistakenly attributed to Oxford that were actually written by Greene, Campion, and Greville. Bénézet also used two lines from Greene that he thought were Oxford's, while succeeding Oxfordians, including Charles Wisner Barrell, have also misattributed poems to Oxford. \"This on-going confusion of Oxford's genuine verse with that of at least three other poets\", writes May, \"illustrates the wholesale failure of the basic Oxfordian methodology.\"\nAccording to a computerised textual comparison developed by the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, the styles of Shakespeare and Oxford were found to be \"light years apart\", and the odds of Oxford having written Shakespeare were reported as \"lower than the odds of getting hit by lightning\". Furthermore, while the First Folio shows traces of a dialect identical to Shakespeare's, the Earl of Oxford, raised in Essex, spoke an East Anglian dialect. John Shahan and Richard Whalen condemned the Claremont study, calling it \"apples to oranges\", and noting that the study did not compare Oxford's songs to Shakespeare's songs, did not compare a clean unconfounded sample of Oxford's poems with Shakespeare's poems, and charged that the students under Elliott and Valenza's supervision incorrectly assumed that Oxford's youthful verse was representative of his mature poetry.\nJoseph Sobran's book, Alias Shakespeare, includes Oxford's known poetry in an appendix with what he considers extensive verbal parallels with the work of Shakespeare, and he argues that Oxford's poetry is comparable in quality to some of Shakespeare's early work, such as Titus Andronicus. Other Oxfordians say that de Vere's extant work is that of a young man and should be considered juvenilia, while May believes that all the evidence dates his surviving work to his early 20s and later.\n\n\n=== Contemporary reception ===\nFour contemporary critics praise Oxford as a poet and a playwright, three of them within his lifetime:\n\nWilliam Webbe's Discourse of English Poetrie (1586) surveys and criticises the early Elizabethan poets and their works. He parenthetically mentions those of Elizabeth's court, and names Oxford as \"the most excellent\" among them.\nThe Arte of English Poesie (1589), attributed to George Puttenham, includes Oxford on a list of courtier poets and prints some of his verses as exemplars of \"his excellencie and wit.\" He also praises Oxford and Richard Edwardes as playwrights, saying that they \"deserve the hyest price\" for the works of \"Comedy and Enterlude\" that he has seen.\nFrancis Meres' 1598 Palladis Tamia mentions both Oxford and Shakespeare as among several playwrights who are \"the best for comedy amongst us\".\nHenry Peacham's 1622 The Compleat Gentleman includes Oxford on a list of courtier and would-be courtier Elizabethan poets.\nMainstream scholarship characterises the extravagant praise for de Vere's poetry more as a convention of flattery than honest appreciation of literary merit. Alan Nelson, de Vere's documentary biographer, writes that \"[c]ontemporary observers such as Harvey, Webbe, Puttenham and Meres clearly exaggerated Oxford's talent in deference to his rank.\"\n\n\n=== Perceived allusions to Oxford as a concealed writer ===\nBefore the advent of copyright, anonymous and pseudonymous publication was a common practice in the sixteenth century publishing world, and a passage in the Arte of English Poesie (1589), an anonymously published work itself, mentions in passing that literary figures in the court who wrote \"commendably well\" circulated their poetry only among their friends, \"as if it were a discredit for a gentleman to seem learned\" (Book 1, Chapter 8). In another passage 23 chapters later, the author (probably George Puttenham) speaks of aristocratic writers who, if their writings were made public, would appear to be excellent. It is in this passage that Oxford appears on a list of poets.\nAccording to Daniel Wright, these combined passages confirm that Oxford was one of the concealed writers in the Elizabethan court. Critics of this view argue that neither Oxford nor any other writer is here identified as a concealed writer, but as the first in a list of known modern writers whose works have already been \"made public\", \"of which number is first\" Oxford, adding to the publicly acknowledged literary tradition dating back to Geoffrey Chaucer. Other critics interpret the passage to mean that the courtly writers and their works are known within courtly circles, but not to the general public. In either case, neither Oxford nor anyone else is identified as a hidden writer or one that used a pseudonym.\nOxfordians argue that at the time of the passage's composition (pre-1589), the writers referenced were not in print, and interpret Puttenham's passage (that the noblemen preferred to 'suppress' their work to avoid the discredit of appearing learned) to mean that they were 'concealed'. They cite Sir Philip Sidney, none of whose poetry was published until after his premature death, as an example. Similarly, up to 1589 nothing by Greville was in print, and only one of Walter Raleigh's works had been published.\nCritics point out that six of the nine poets listed had appeared in print under their own names long before 1589, including a number of Oxford's poems in printed miscellanies, and the first poem published under Oxford's name was printed in 1572, 17 years before Puttenham's book was published. Several other contemporary authors name Oxford as a poet, and Puttenham himself quotes one of Oxford's verses elsewhere in the book, referring to him by name as the author, so Oxfordians misread Puttenham.\nOxfordians also believe other texts refer to the Edward de Vere as a concealed writer. They argue that satirist John Marston's Scourge of Villanie (1598) contains further cryptic allusions to Oxford, named as \"Mutius\". Marston expert Arnold Davenport believes that Mutius is the bishop-poet Joseph Hall and that Marston is criticising Hall's satires.\nThere is a description of the figure of Oxford in The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, a 1613 play by George Chapman, who has been suggested as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Chapman describes Oxford as \"Rare and most absolute\" in form and says he was \"of spirit passing great / Valiant and learn’d, and liberal as the sun\". He adds that he \"spoke and writ sweetly\" of both learned subjects and matters of state (\"public weal\").\n\n\n== Chronology of the plays and Oxford's 1604 death ==\nFor mainstream Shakespearian scholars, the most compelling evidence against Oxford (besides the historical evidence for William Shakespeare) is his death in 1604, since the generally accepted chronology of Shakespeare's plays places the composition of approximately twelve of the plays after that date. Critics often cite The Tempest and Macbeth, for example, as having been written after 1604.\nThe exact dates of the composition of most of Shakespeare's plays are uncertain, although David Bevington says it is a 'virtually unanimous' opinion among teachers and scholars of Shakespeare that the canon of late plays depicts an artistic journey that extends well beyond 1604. Evidence for this includes allusions to historical events and literary sources which postdate 1604, as well as Shakespeare's adaptation of his style to accommodate Jacobean literary tastes and the changing membership of the King's Men and their different venues.\nOxfordians say that the conventional composition dates for the plays were developed by mainstream scholars to fit within Shakespeare's lifetime and that no evidence exists that any plays were written after 1604. Anderson argues that all of the Jacobean plays were written before 1604, selectively citing non-Oxfordian scholars like Alfred Harbage, Karl Elze, and Andrew Cairncross to bolster his case. Anderson notes that from 1593 through 1603, the publication of new plays appeared at the rate of two per year, and whenever an inferior or pirated text was published, it was typically followed by a genuine text described on the title page as \"newly augmented\" or \"corrected\". After the publication of the Q1 and Q2 Hamlet in 1603, no new plays were published until 1608. Anderson observes that, \"After 1604, the 'newly correct[ing]' and 'augment[ing]' stops. Once again, the Shake-speare [sic] enterprise appears to have shut down\".\n\n\n=== Notable silences ===\nBecause Shakespeare lived until 1616, Oxfordians question why, if he were the author, did he not eulogise Queen Elizabeth at her death in 1603 or Henry, Prince of Wales, at his in 1612. They believe Oxford's 1604 death provides the explanation. In an age when such actions were expected, Shakespeare also failed to memorialise the coronation of James I in 1604, the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1612, and the investiture of Prince Charles as the new Prince of Wales in 1613.\nAnderson contends that Shakespeare refers to the latest scientific discoveries and events through the end of the 16th century, but \"is mute about science after de Vere’s [Oxford’s] death in 1604\". He believes that the absence of any mention of the spectacular supernova of October 1604 or Kepler’s revolutionary 1609 study of planetary orbits are especially noteworthy.\n\n\n=== The move to the Blackfriars ===\nProfessor Jonathan Bate writes that Oxfordians cannot \"provide any explanation for ... technical changes attendant on the King's Men's move to the Blackfriars theatre four years after their candidate's death .... Unlike the Globe, the Blackfriars was an indoor playhouse\" and so required plays with frequent breaks in order to replace the candles it used for lighting. \"The plays written after Shakespeare's company began using the Blackfriars in 1608, Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale for instance, have what most ... of the earlier plays do not have: a carefully planned five-act structure\". If new Shakespearian plays were being written especially for presentation at the Blackfriars' theatre after 1608, they could not have been written by Edward de Vere.\nOxfordians argue that Oxford was well acquainted with the Blackfriars Theatre, having been a leaseholder of the venue, and note that the \"assumption\" that Shakespeare wrote plays for the Blackfriars is not universally accepted, citing Shakespearian scholars such as A. Nicoll who said that \"all available evidence is either completely negative or else runs directly counter to such a supposition\" and Harley Granville-Barker, who stated \"Shakespeare did not write (except for Henry V) five-act plays at any stage of his career. The five-act structure was formalized in the First Folio, and is inauthentic\".\n\n\n=== Shakespeare's late collaborations ===\nFurther, attribution studies have shown that certain plays in the canon were written by two or three hands, which Oxfordians believe is explained by these plays being either drafted earlier than conventionally believed, or simply revised/completed by others after Oxford's death. Shapiro calls this a 'nightmare' for Oxfordians, implying a 'jumble sale scenario' for his literary remains long after his death.\n\n\n=== Identification of earlier works with Shakespeare plays ===\nSome Oxfordians have identified titles or descriptions of lost works from Oxford's lifetime that suggest a thematic similarity to a particular Shakespearian play and asserted that they were earlier versions. For example, in 1732, the antiquarian Francis Peck published in Desiderata Curiosa a list of documents in his possession that he intended to print someday. They included \"a pleasant conceit of Vere, earl of Oxford, discontented at the rising of a mean gentleman in the English court, circa 1580.\" Peck never published his archives, which are now lost. To Anderson, Peck's description suggests that this conceit is \"arguably an early draft of Twelfth Night.\"\n\n\n=== Contemporary references to Shakespeare as alive or dead ===\n\nOxfordian writers say some literary allusions imply that the playwright and poet died prior to 1609, when Shake-Speares Sonnets appeared with the epithet \"our ever-living poet\" in its dedication. They claim that the phrase \"ever-living\" rarely, if ever, referred to a living person, but instead was used to refer to the eternal soul of the deceased. Bacon, Derby, Neville, and William Shakespeare all lived well past the 1609 publication of the Sonnets.\nHowever, Don Foster, in his study of Early Modern uses of the phrase \"ever-living\", argues that the phrase most frequently refers to God or other supernatural beings, suggesting that the dedication calls upon God to bless the living begetter (writer) of the sonnets. He states that the initials \"W. H.\" were a misprint for \"W. S.\" or \"W. SH\". Bate thinks it a misprint as well, but he thinks it \"improbable\" that the phrase refers to God and suggests that the \"ever-living poet\" might be \"a great dead English poet who had written on the great theme of poetic immortality\", such as Sir Philip Sidney or Edmund Spenser.\nJoseph Sobran, in Alias Shakespeare, argued that in 1607 William Barksted, a minor poet and playwright, implies in his poem \"Mirrha the Mother of Adonis\" that Shakespeare was already deceased. Shakespeare scholars explain that Sobran has simply misread Barksted’s poem, the last stanza of which is a comparison of Barksted’s poem to Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis, and has mistaken the grammar also, which makes it clear that Barksted is referring to Shakespeare’s \"song\" in the past tense, not Shakespeare himself. This context is obvious when the rest of the stanza is included.\nAgainst the Oxford theory are several references to Shakespeare, later than 1604, which imply that the author was then still alive. Scholars point to a poem written circa 1620 by a student at Oxford, William Basse, that mentioned the author Shakespeare died in 1616, which is the year Shakespeare deceased and not Edward de Vere.\n\n\n=== Dates of composition ===\n\n\n==== The Two Gentlemen of Verona ====\nTom Veal has noted that the early play The Two Gentlemen of Verona reveals no familiarity on the playwright's part with Italy other than \"a few place names and the scarcely recondite fact that the inhabitants were Roman Catholics.\" For example, the play's Verona is situated on a tidal river and has a duke, and none of the characters have distinctly Italian names like in the later plays. Therefore, if the play was written by Oxford, it must have been before he visited Italy in 1575. However, the play's principal source, the Spanish Diana Enamorada, would not be translated into French or English until 1578, meaning that someone basing a play on it that early could only have read it in the original Spanish, and there is no evidence that Oxford spoke this language. Furthermore, Veal argues, the only explanation for the verbal parallels with the English translation of 1582 would be that the translator saw the play performed and echoed it in his translation, which he describes as \"not an impossible theory but far from a plausible one.\"\n\n\n==== Hamlet ====\nThe composition date of Hamlet has been frequently disputed. Several surviving references indicate that a Hamlet-like play was well-known throughout the 1590s, well before the traditional period of composition (1599–1601). Most scholars refer to this lost early play as the Ur-Hamlet; the earliest reference is in 1589. A 1594 performance record of Hamlet appears in Philip Henslowe's diary, and Thomas Lodge wrote of it in 1596.\nOxfordian researchers believe that the play is an early version of Shakespeare's own play, and point to the fact that Shakespeare's version survives in three quite different early texts, Q1 (1603), Q2 (1604) and F (1623), suggesting the possibility that it was revised by the author over a period of many years.\n\n\n==== Macbeth ====\nScholars contend that the composition date of Macbeth is one of the most overwhelming pieces of evidence against the Oxfordian position; the vast majority of critics believe the play was written in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot. This plot was brought to light on 5 November 1605, a year after Oxford died. In particular, scholars identify the porter's lines about \"equivocation\" and treason as an allusion to the trial of Henry Garnet in 1606. Oxfordians respond that the concept of \"equivocation\" was the subject of a 1583 tract by Queen Elizabeth's chief councillor (and Oxford's father-in-law) Lord Burghley, as well as of the 1584 Doctrine of Equivocation by the Spanish prelate Martín de Azpilcueta, which was disseminated across Europe and into England in the 1590s.\n\n\n==== Coriolanus ====\nShakespearian scholar David Haley asserts that if Edward de Vere had written Coriolanus, he \"must have foreseen the Midland Revolt grain riots [of 1607] reported in Coriolanus\", possible topical allusions in the play that most Shakespearians accept.\n\n\n==== The Tempest ====\n\nThe play that can be dated within a fourteen-month period is The Tempest. This play has long been believed to have been inspired by the 1609 wreck at Bermuda, then feared by mariners as the Isle of the Devils, of the flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture, while leading the Third Supply to relieve Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia. The Sea Venture was captained by Christopher Newport, and carried the Admiral of the company's fleet, Sir George Somers (for whom the archipelago would subsequently be named The Somers Isles). The survivors spent nine months in Bermuda before most completed the journey to Jamestown on 23 May 1610 aboard two new ships built from scratch. One of the survivors was the newly-appointed Governor, Sir Thomas Gates. Jamestown, then little more than a rudimentary fort, was found in such a poor condition, with the majority of the previous settlers dead or dying, that Gates and Somers decided to abandon the settlement and the continent, returning everyone to England. However, with the company believing all aboard the Sea Venture dead, a new governor, Baron De La Warr, had been sent with the Fourth Supply fleet, which arrived on 10 June 1610 as Jamestown was being abandoned.\nDe la Warr remained in Jamestown as Governor, while Gates returned to England (and Somers to Bermuda), arriving in September, 1610. The news of the survival of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew caused a great sensation in England. Two accounts were published: Sylvester Jordain's A Discovery of the Barmvdas, Otherwise Called the Ile of Divels, in October, 1610, and A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia a month later. The True Reportory of the Wrack, and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates Knight, an account by William Strachey dated 15 July 1610, returned to England with Gates in the form of a letter which was circulated privately until its eventual publication in 1625. Shakespeare had multiple contacts to the circle of people amongst whom the letter circulated, including to Strachey. The Tempest shows clear evidence that he had read and relied on Jordain and especially Strachey. The play shares premise, basic plot, and many details of the Sea Venture's wrecking and the adventures of the survivors, as well as specific details and linguistics. A detailed comparative analysis shows the Declaration to have been the primary source from which the play was drawn. This firmly dates the writing of the play to the months between Gates' return to England and 1 November 1611 (when the first recorded performance occurred).\nOxfordians have dealt with this problem in several ways. Looney expelled the play from the canon, arguing that its style and the \"dreary negativism\" it promoted were inconsistent with Shakespeare's \"essentially positivist\" soul, and so could not have been written by Oxford. Later Oxfordians have generally abandoned this argument; this has made severing the connection of the play with the wreck of the Sea Venture a priority amongst Oxfordians. A variety of attacks have been directed on the links. These include attempting to cast doubt on whether the Declaration travelled back to England with Gates, whether Gates travelled back to England early enough, whether the lowly Shakespeare would have had access to the lofty circles in which the Declaration was circulated, to understating the points of similarity between the Sea Venture wreck and the accounts of it, on the one hand, and the play on the other. Oxfordians have even claimed that the writers of the first-hand accounts of the real wreck based them on The Tempest, or, at least, the same antiquated sources that Shakespeare, or rather Oxford, is imagined to have used exclusively, including Richard Eden's The Decades of the New Worlde Or West India (1555) and Desiderius Erasmus's Naufragium/The Shipwreck (1523). Alden Vaughan commented in 2008 that \"[t]he argument that Shakespeare could have gotten every thematic thread, every detail of the storm, and every similarity of word and phrase from other sources stretches credulity to the limits.\"\n\n\n==== Henry VIII ====\nOxfordians note that while the conventional dating for Henry VIII is 1610–13, the majority of 18th and 19th century scholars, including notables such as Samuel Johnson, Lewis Theobald, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, and James Halliwell-Phillipps, placed the composition of Henry VIII prior to 1604, as they believed Elizabeth's execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (the then king James I's mother) made any vigorous defence of the Tudors politically inappropriate in the England of James I. Though it is described as a new play by two witnesses in 1613, Oxfordians argue that this refers to the fact it was new on stage, having its first production in that year.\n\n\n== Oxfordian cryptology ==\nAlthough searching Shakespeare's works for encrypted clues supposedly left by the true author is associated mainly with the Baconian theory, such arguments are often made by Oxfordians as well. Early Oxfordians found many references to Oxford's family name \"Vere\" in the plays and poems, in supposed puns on words such as \"ever\" (E. Vere). In The De Vere Code, a book by English actor Jonathan Bond, the author believes that Thomas Thorpe's 30-word dedication to the original publication of Shakespeare's Sonnets contains six simple encryptions which conclusively establish de Vere as the author of the poems. He also writes that the alleged encryptions settle the question of the identity of \"the Fair Youth\" as Henry Wriothesley and contain striking references to the sonnets themselves and de Vere's relationship to Sir Philip Sidney and Ben Jonson.\nSimilarly, a 2009 article in the Oxfordian journal Brief Chronicles noted that Francis Meres in Palladis Tamia compares 17 named English poets to 16 named classical poets. Writing that Meres was obsessed with numerology, the authors propose that the numbers should be symmetrical, and that careful readers are meant to infer that Meres knew two of the English poets (viz., Oxford and Shakespeare) to actually be one and the same.\n\n\n== Parallels with the plays ==\nLiterary scholars say that the idea that an author's work must reflect his or her life is a Modernist assumption not held by Elizabethan writers, and that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship. Further, such lists of similarities between incidents in the plays and the life of an aristocrat are flawed arguments because similar lists have been drawn up for many competing candidates, such as Francis Bacon and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Harold Love writes that \"The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability,\" and Jonathan Bate writes that the Oxfordian biographical method \"is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare's range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that it would be possible to find in the plays 'self-portraits' of ... anybody one cares to think of.\"\nDespite this, Oxfordians list numerous incidents in Oxford's life that they say parallel those in many of the Shakespeare plays. Most notable among these, they say, are certain similar incidents found in Oxford's biography and Hamlet, and Henry IV, Part 1, which includes a well-known robbery scene with uncanny parallels to a real-life incident involving Oxford.\n\n\n=== Hamlet ===\nMost Oxfordians consider Hamlet the play most easily seen as portraying Oxford's life story, though mainstream scholars say that incidents from the lives of other contemporary figures such as King James or the Earl of Essex, fit the play just as closely, if not more so.\nHamlet's father was murdered and his mother made an \"o'er-hasty marriage\" less than two months later. Oxfordians see a parallel with Oxford's life, as Oxford's father died at the age of 46 on 3 August 1562, although not before making a will six days earlier, and his stepmother remarried within 15 months, although exactly when is unknown.\nAnother frequently-cited parallel involves Hamlet's revelation in Act IV that he was earlier taken captive by pirates. On Oxford's return from Europe in 1576, he encountered a cavalry division outside of Paris that was being led by a German duke, and his ship was hijacked by pirates who robbed him and left him stripped to his shirt, and who might have murdered him had not one of them recognised him. Anderson notes that \"[n]either the encounter with Fortinbras' army nor Hamlet's brush with buccaneers appears in any of the play's sources – to the puzzlement of numerous literary critics.\"\n\n\n==== Polonius ====\n\nSuch speculation often identifies the character of Polonius as a caricature of Lord Burghley, Oxford's guardian from the age of 12.\nIn the First Quarto the character was not named Polonius, but Corambis. Ogburn writes that Cor ambis can be interpreted as \"two-hearted\" (a view not independently supported by Latinists). He says the name is a swipe \"at Burghley's motto, Cor unum, via una, or 'one heart, one way.'\" Scholars suggest that it derives from the Latin phrase \"crambe repetita\" meaning \"reheated cabbage\", which was expanded in Elizabethan usage to \"Crambe bis posita mors est\" (\"twice served cabbage is deadly\"), which implies \"a boring old man\" who spouts trite rehashed ideas. Similar variants such as \"Crambo\" and \"Corabme\" appear in Latin-English dictionaries at the time.\n\n\n=== Bed trick ===\nIn his Memoires (1658), Francis Osborne writes of \"the last great Earle of Oxford, whose Lady was brought to his bed under the notion of his Mistris, and from such a virtuous deceit she (Oxford's youngest daughter) is said to proceed\" (p. 79).\nSuch a bed trick has been a dramatic convention since antiquity and was used more than 40 times by every major playwright in the Early Modern theatre era except for Ben Jonson. Thomas Middleton used it five times and Shakespeare and James Shirley used it four times. Shakespeare's use of it in All's Well That Ends Well and Measure for Measure followed his sources for the plays (stories by Boccaccio and Cinthio); nevertheless Oxfordians say that de Vere was drawn to these stories because they \"paralleled his own\", based on Osborne's anecdote.\n\n\n=== Earls of Oxford in the histories ===\nOxfordians claim that flattering treatment of Oxford's ancestors in Shakespeare's history plays is evidence of his authorship. Shakespeare omitted the character of the traitorous Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford in The Life and Death of King John, and the character of the 12th Earl of Oxford is given a much more prominent role in Henry V than his limited involvement in the actual history of the times would allow. The 12th Earl is given an even more prominent role in the non-Shakespearian play The Famous Victories of Henry the fifth. Some Oxfordians argue that this was another play written by Oxford, based on the exaggerated role it gave to the 11th Earl of Oxford.\nJ. Thomas Looney found John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford is \"hardly mentioned except to be praised\" in Henry VI, Part Three; the play ahistorically depicts him participating in the Battle of Tewkesbury and being captured. Oxfordians, such as Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn, believe Shakespeare created such a role for the 13th Earl because it was the easiest way Edward de Vere could have \"advertised his loyalty to the Tudor Queen\" and remind her of \"the historic part borne by the Earls of Oxford in defeating the usurpers and restoring the Lancastrians to power\". Looney also notes that in Richard III, when the future Henry VII appears, the same Earl of Oxford is \"by his side; and it is Oxford who, as premier nobleman, replies first to the king's address to his followers\".\nNon-Oxfordian writers do not see any evidence of partiality for the de Vere family in the plays. Richard de Vere, 11th Earl of Oxford, who plays a prominent role in the anonymous The Famous Victories of Henry V, does not appear in Shakespeare's Henry V, nor is he even mentioned. In Richard III, Oxford's reply to the king noted by Looney is a mere two lines, the only lines he speaks in the play. He has a much more prominent role in the non-Shakespearian play The True Tragedy of Richard III. On these grounds the scholar Benjamin Griffin argues that the non-Shakespearian plays, the Famous Victories and True Tragedy, are the ones connected to Oxford, possibly written for Oxford's Men. Oxfordian Charlton Ogburn Jr. argues that the role of the Earls of Oxford was played down in Henry V and Richard III to maintain Oxford's nominal anonymity. This is because \"It would not do to have a performance of one of his plays at Court greeted with ill-suppressed knowing chuckles.\"\n\n\n=== Oxford's finances ===\nIn 1577 the Company of Cathay was formed to support Martin Frobisher's hunt for the Northwest Passage, although Frobisher and his investors quickly became distracted by reports of gold at Hall’s Island. With thoughts of an impending Canadian gold-rush and trusting in the financial advice of Michael Lok, the treasurer of the company, de Vere signed a bond for £3,000 in order to invest £1,000 and to assume £2,000 worth – about half – of Lok's personal investment in the enterprise. Oxfordians say this is similar to Antonio in The Merchant of Venice, who was indebted to Shylock for 3,000 ducats against the successful return of his vessels.\nOxfordians also note that when de Vere travelled through Venice, he borrowed 500 crowns from a Baptista Nigrone. In Padua, he borrowed from a man named Pasquino Spinola. In The Taming of the Shrew, Kate's father is described as a man \"rich in crowns.\" He, too, is from Padua, and his name is Baptista Minola, which Oxfordians take to be a conflation of Baptista Nigrone and Pasquino Spinola.\nWhen the character of Antipholus of Ephesus in The Comedy of Errors tells his servant to go out and buy some rope, the servant (Dromio) replies, \"I buy a thousand pounds a year! I buy a rope!\" (Act 4, scene 1). The meaning of Dromio’s line has not been satisfactorily explained by critics, but Oxfordians say the line is somehow connected to the fact that de Vere was given a £1,000 annuity by the Queen, later continued by King James.\n\n\n=== Marriage and affairs ===\n\nOxfordians see Oxford's marriage to Anne Cecil, Lord Burghley's daughter, paralleled in such plays as Hamlet, Othello, Cymbeline, The Merry Wives of Windsor, All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Much Ado About Nothing, and The Winter's Tale.\nOxford's illicit congress with Anne Vavasour resulted in an intermittent series of street battles between the Knyvet clan, led by Anne's uncle, Sir Thomas Knyvet, and Oxford’s men. As in Romeo and Juliet, this imbroglio produced three deaths and several other injuries. The feud was finally put to an end only by the intervention of the Queen.\n\n\n=== Oxford's criminal associations ===\nIn May 1573, in a letter to Lord Burghley, two of Oxford's former employees accused three of Oxford's friends of attacking them on \"the highway from Gravesend to Rochester.\" In Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, Falstaff and three roguish friends of Prince Hal also waylay unwary travellers at Gad's Hill, which is on the highway from Gravesend to Rochester. Scott McCrea says that there is little similarity between the two events, since the crime described in the letter is unlikely to have occurred near Gad's Hill and was not a robbery, but rather an attempted shooting. Mainstream writers also say that this episode derives from an earlier anonymous play, The Famous Victories of Henry V, which was Shakespeare's source. Some Oxfordians argue that The Famous Victories was written by Oxford, based on the exaggerated role it gave to the 11th Earl of Oxford.\n\n\n== Parallels with the sonnets and poems ==\nIn 1609, a volume of 154 linked poems was published under the title SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS. Oxfordians believe the title (Shake-Speares Sonnets) suggests a finality indicating that it was a completed body of work with no further sonnets expected, and consider the differences of opinion among Shakespearian scholars as to whether the Sonnets are fictional or autobiographical to be a serious problem facing orthodox scholars. Joseph Sobran questions why Shakespeare (who lived until 1616) failed to publish a corrected and authorised edition if they are fiction, as well as why they fail to match Shakespeare's life story if they are autobiographic. According to Sobran and other researchers, the themes and personal circumstances expounded by the author of the Sonnets are remarkably similar to Oxford's biography.\n\n\n=== The Fair Youth, the Dark Lady, and the Rival Poet ===\n\nThe focus of the 154 sonnet series appears to narrate the author's relationships with three characters: the Fair Youth, the Dark Lady or Mistress, and the Rival Poet. Beginning with Looney, most Oxfordians (exceptions are Percy Allen and Louis Bénézet) believe that the \"Fair Youth\" referred to in the early sonnets refers to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, Oxford's peer and prospective son-in-law. The Dark Lady is believed by some Oxfordians to be Anne Vavasour, Oxford's mistress who bore him a son out of wedlock. A case was made by the Oxfordian Peter R. Moore that the Rival Poet was Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.\nSobran suggests that the so-called procreation sonnets were part of a campaign by Burghley to persuade Southampton to marry his granddaughter, Oxford's daughter Elizabeth de Vere, and says that it was more likely that Oxford would have participated in such a campaign than that Shakespeare would know the parties involved or presume to give advice to the nobility.\nOxfordians also assert that the tone of the poems is that of a nobleman addressing an equal rather than that of a poet addressing his patron. According to them, Sonnet 91 (which compares the Fair Youth's love to such treasures as high birth, wealth, and horses) implies that the author is in a position to make such comparisons, and the 'high birth' he refers to is his own.\n\n\n=== Age and lameness ===\nOxford was born in 1550, and was between 40 and 53 years old when he presumably would have written the sonnets. Shakespeare was born in 1564. Even though the average life expectancy of Elizabethans was short, being between 26 and 39 was not considered old. In spite of this, age and growing older are recurring themes in the Sonnets, for example, in Sonnets 138 and 37. In his later years, Oxford described himself as \"lame\". On several occasions, the author of the sonnets also described himself as lame, such as in Sonnets 37 and 89.\n\n\n=== Public disgrace ===\nSobran also believes \"scholars have largely ignored one of the chief themes of the Sonnets: the poet's sense of disgrace ... [T]here can be no doubt that the poet is referring to something real that he expects his friends to know about; in fact, he makes clear that a wide public knows about it ... Once again the poet's situation matches Oxford's ... He has been a topic of scandal on several occasions. And his contemporaries saw the course of his life as one of decline from great wealth, honor, and promise to disgrace and ruin. This perception was underlined by enemies who accused him of every imaginable offense and perversion, charges he was apparently unable to rebut.\" Examples include Sonnets 29 and 112.\nAs early as 1576, Edward de Vere was writing about this subject in his poem Loss of Good Name, which Steven W. May described as \"a defiant lyric without precedent in English Renaissance verse.\"\n\n\n=== Lost fame ===\nThe poems Venus and Adonis and Lucrece, first published in 1593 and 1594 under the name \"William Shakespeare\", proved highly popular for several decades – with Venus and Adonis published six more times before 1616, while Lucrece required four additional printings during this same period. By 1598, they were so famous, London poet and sonneteer Richard Barnefield wrote:\n\nDespite such publicity, Sobran observed, \"[t]he author of the Sonnets expects and hopes to be forgotten. While he is confident that his poetry will outlast marble and monument, it will immortalize his young friend, not himself. He says that his style is so distinctive and unchanging that 'every word doth almost tell my name,' implying that his name is otherwise concealed – at a time when he is publishing long poems under the name William Shakespeare. This seems to mean that he is not writing these Sonnets under that (hidden) name.\" Oxfordians have interpreted the phrase \"every word\" as a pun on the word \"every\", standing for \"e vere\" – thus telling his name. Mainstream writers respond that several sonnets literally do tell his name, containing numerous puns on the name Will[iam]; in sonnet 136 the poet directly says \"thou lov'st me for my name is Will.\"\nBased on Sonnets 81, 72, and others, Oxfordians assert that if the author expected his \"name\" to be \"forgotten\" and \"buried\", it would not have been the name that permanently adorned the published works themselves.\n\n\n== In fiction ==\n\nLeslie Howard's 1943 anti-Nazi film \"Pimpernel\" Smith features dialogue by the protagonist endorsing the Oxfordian theory.\nIn the afterword of the 2000 young adult novel A Question of Will, author Lynne Kositsky addresses the debate over who really wrote Shakespeare's plays, supporting the Oxfordian theory.\nOxfordian theory, and the Shakespeare authorship question in general, is the basis of Amy Freed's 2001 play The Beard of Avon.\nOxfordian theory is central to the plot of Sarah Smith's 2003 novel Chasing Shakespeares.\nThe 2005 young adult novel Shakespeare's Secret by Elise Broach is centred on the Oxfordian theory.\nThe Oxfordian theory, among others, is discussed in Jennifer Lee Carrell's 2007 novel Interred With Their Bones.\nThe 2011 film Anonymous, directed by Roland Emmerich, portrays the Prince Tudor theory.\nThe theory is mocked in a 5 minute scene in the 2014 movie The Gambler.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Oxfordian theory supporters\nBaconian theory\nDerbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship\nMarlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship\nNevillean theory of Shakespeare authorship\n\n\n== Citations ==\nUK and US editions of Shapiro 2010 differ significantly in pagination; the citations here are to the UK edition so page numbers reflect that edition.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA'Dair, Mike.

        "wikipedia_content": "Right-wing antiglobalism, also referred to as the antiglobalist right, is a political position opposing globalization, arguing that  it endangers national economies and identities and promotes immigration. Instead, right-wing globalists support nationalism as a cure for the alleged problems caused by the globalization.  Right-wing antiglobalism protests against the Sustainable Development Goals, 15-minute cities, and COVID-19 vaccines as being created or promoted by globalists.\nRight-wing antiglobalists frequently use the term globalist as a pejorative and in various conspiracy theories, notably linking with the New World Order conspiracy theory, and as a trope within the new antisemitism movement; although certain right-wing antiglobalist leaders, such as Javier Milei, also hold pro-Israel principles.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRight-wing antiglobalism began to gain traction in the 2010s in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, which were previously seen as one of the major supporters of the globalization. Before the 21st century, most of the critiques of globalism came from its impact on the Global South. In the 21st century, there have been increasing concerns about its effect on the Global North. Globalism has been criticized as leading to the outsourcing of jobs and cultural homogenization.\n\n\n== Allegations of antisemitism ==\n\nFollowers of the QAnon conspiracy theory refer to what they term \"the cabal\" as a secret worldwide elite organization that wishes to undermine democracy and freedom and implement their globalist agendas. Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán has used antisemitic tropes in accusations against globalists, espousing a conspiracy theory of a world network controlled by Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros. During the election and presidency of United States president Donald Trump, he and members of his administration used the term globalist on multiple occasions. The administration was accused of using the term as an antisemitic dog whistle, and to associate their critics with an international Jewish conspiracy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKiely, Ray (2020).

        "title": "The School of Night",
        "wikipedia_content": "The School of Night is a modern name for a group of men centred on Sir Walter Raleigh that was once referred to in 1592 as the \"School of Atheism\". The group supposedly included poets and scientists Christopher Marlowe, George Chapman, Matthew Roydon and Thomas Harriot. \nThere is no firm evidence that all of these men were known to each other, but speculation about their connections features prominently in some writing about the Elizabethan era.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nRaleigh was first named as the centre of the \"School of Atheism\" by the Jesuit priest Robert Persons in 1592. \"School of Night\", however, is a modern appellation: the theory that this purported school was a clandestine intellectual coterie was launched by Arthur Acheson on textual grounds, in his Shakespeare and the Rival Poet (1903).  The new name is a reference to a passage in Act IV, scene 3 of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost, in which the King of Navarre says \"Black is the badge of hell / The hue of dungeons and the school of night.\"  Acheson's proposal was endorsed by notable editors John Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller Couch in their 1923 edition of Love's Labour's Lost. There are, however, at least two other recorded renderings of the line, one reading \"suit of night\" and the other as \"scowl of night\".\nThe context of the lines has nothing to do with cabals: the King is simply mocking the black hair of Rosaline, his friend Berowne's lover. John Kerrigan explains that the line is perfectly straightforward as it stands, a riposte to Berowne's praise of his dark-haired mistress as \"fair\",  and any attempts to load it with topical significance are misleading; the simple meaning of \"black is the school where night learns to be black\" is all that is required. \nIn 1936 Frances Yates found an unpublished essay on scholarship by the Earl of Northumberland, an associate of Raleigh and supposed member of the movement, and interpreted the earl's mockery of the \"precious affectations\" found among scholars as inspiring the key celibacy theme of the play. The supposition is discounted as fanciful by some, but nonetheless received acceptance by some prominent commentators of the time.\n\n\n== Atheism ==\nIt is alleged that each of these men studied science, philosophy, and religion, and all were suspected of atheism. Atheism at that time was a charge nearly the equivalent of treason, since the  English monarch after Henry VIII's reforms was the head of the Church of England, and to be against the church was, ipso facto, to be against the monarch.  However, it was also a name for anarchy, and was a charge frequently brought against the politically troublesome.  Richard Baines, an anti-Catholic spy for her Majesty's Privy Council, whose \"task was presumably to provide his masters with what they required\", charged in an unsworn deposition that he had heard from another that Marlowe  had \"read the Atheist lecture to Sr. Walter Raleigh [and] others\". This tale of hearsay, from a paid informer, failed to substantiate the charges of atheism against the group, but it did include a promise of more evidence to be revealed at a later date.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nSince the early 1990s (by which point the School of Night hypothesis had fallen out of mainstream academic favour), the School of Night has frequently been represented in fiction.\nA play titled The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, dealing with the relationship between Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place theatre in November 1992.  The School of Night also figures prominently in novels: The Scholars of Night (1988) by John M. Ford, a Cold War thriller involving an undiscovered Christopher Marlowe play; A Dead Man in Deptford (1993) by Anthony Burgess; Veronica (1996) by Nicholas Christopher; School of the Night (2000) by Judith Cook; The School of Night (2001) by Alan Wall, a story of a present-day researcher who becomes obsessed by connections between Shakespeare's plays and members of the \"school\"; The School of Night (2010) by Louis Bayard; and Shadow of Night (2012) by Deborah Harkness.\nThe School of Night is also the name of a group of actors and improvisers inspired by the original group and brought together under the auspices of the celebrated theatrical maverick Ken Campbell. The idea is that this group of poets, playwrights, scientists and thinkers might have collectively written the plays attributed to the Bard. The modern-day School of Night shows feature improvisation in the style of poets and playwrights suggested by the audience, and generally includes the creation (or in the jargon of the show 'channeling') of a lost Shakespearean masterpiece.\nIn October 2023, Karl Ove Knausgård released a book called \"Nattskolen\" (directly translated \"The school of night\") in which Marlowe's \"Dr. Faustus\" plays a prominent role.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Witch-cult hypothesis",
        "wikipedia_content": "The witch-cult hypothesis is a discredited theory that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an attempt to suppress a pagan religion that had survived the Christianization of Europe. According to its proponents, accused witches were actually followers of this alleged religion. They argue that the witch cult revolved around worshiping a Horned God of fertility and the underworld, whom Christian persecutors identified with the Devil, and whose followers held nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath.\nThe theory was pioneered by two German scholars, Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone, in the early nineteenth century, and was adopted by French historian Jules Michelet, American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and American folklorist Charles Leland later that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when it was adopted by British Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books such as The God of the Witches (1931) and her contribution to the Encyclopædia Britannica. Although the \"Murrayite theory\" proved popular among sectors of academia and the general public in the early and mid-twentieth century, it was never accepted by scholars of the witch trials, who publicly disproved it through in-depth research during the 1960s and 1970s.\nContemporary experts in European witchcraft beliefs view the pagan witch cult theory as pseudohistorical. There is now an academic consensus that those accused and executed as witches were not followers of any witch religion, pagan or otherwise. Critics highlight several flaws with the theory. It rested on highly selective use of evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. It also mistakenly assumed that statements made by accused witches were truthful, and not distorted by coercion and torture. Further, despite theories that the witch cult was a pre-Christian survival, there is no evidence of such a pagan witch cult throughout the Middle Ages.\nThe witch-cult hypothesis has influenced literature, being adapted into fiction in works by John Buchan, Robert Graves, and others. It greatly influenced Wicca, a new religious movement of modern Paganism that emerged in mid-twentieth-century Britain and represented itself as a survival of the pagan witch cult. Since the 1960s, Carlo Ginzburg and other scholars have argued that surviving elements of pre-Christian religion in European folk culture influenced Early Modern stereotypes of witchcraft, but scholars still debate how this may relate, if at all, to the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis.\n\n\n== Early modern precedents ==\n\nThe witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an organized effort by authorities in many countries to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to Christendom. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must be separated from the belief in witches, the evil eye, and other such phenomena, which are common features of folk belief worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized in a powerful but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt.\nThis idea of an organized witch-cult originates in the second half of the 15th century, notoriously expounded in the 1486 Malleus Maleficarum. In the following two centuries, witch trials usually included the charge of membership in a demonic conspiracy, gathering in sabbaths, and similar. It was only with the beginning Age of Enlightenment in the early 18th century, that the idea of an organized witch-cult was abandoned.\nEarly Modern testimonies of accused witches \"confirming\" the existence of a witch cult are considered doubtful. Norman Cohn has argued that such testimonies were often given under torture, and that their details were determined mainly by the expectations of the interrogators and by free association on the part of the accused, reflecting only the popular imagination of the times. Carlo Ginzburg and Éva Pócs hold that some of these testimonies can still give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg discovered records of a group calling themselves benandanti, the \"good walkers\" who believed that they combatted witches (streghe) by magical means. The benandanti were persecuted for heresy in the period of 1575 to 1675.\n\n\n== The early theory ==\n\n\n=== Jarcke and Mone ===\nThroughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the alleged crimes. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti wrote that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835. Here, he wrote that the witch stereotype reflected a blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of heresy. Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as having stated that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.\nThe first modern scholar to advance the idea that the witch trials had been designed to wipe out an anti-Christian sect was the German Karl Ernst Jarcke, a professor of criminal law at the University of Berlin. In 1828 he edited the records of a seventeenth-century German witch trial for publication in a legal journal, and included the theory in his own comments. Jarcke suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian religion that survived Christianisation among the rural population, but that after being condemned as Satanism by the Church, it eventually degenerated into genuine Devil-worship and malevolence. At that point, the wider population came to reject it, resulting in the trials. This theory exonerated the Christian Church of blame by asserting that they had been acting on the wishes of the population, while at the same time not accepting the literal intervention of the Devil in human affairs which liberal rationalists disbelieved. In 1832, Felix Mendelssohn adopted similar ideas when composing his orchestral piece, Die Erste Walpurgisnacht, in which a group of pagan villagers pretend to be witches in order to scare away Christians intent on disrupting their Walpurgis Night festivities.\nJarcke's theories were adopted and altered by the German historian Franz Josef Mone in 1839. While serving as director of archives at Baden, he published his ideas in a paper in which he asserted that the pre-Christian religion which degenerated into Satanic witchcraft was not Germanic in origin, but had instead been practised by slaves who had come in contact with the Greek cults of Hecate and Dionysus on the north coast of the Black Sea. According to Mone, these slaves adopted these cults and fused them with their own pagan faiths to form witchcraft, a religion that venerated a goat-like god, celebrated nocturnal orgies and practised poisoning and malevolent magic. This horrified the free-born population both in the pagan period and the Christian era, eventually resulting in the witch trials. However, as English historian Norman Cohn asserted in 1975, \"neither of [Jarcke or Mone's] theories are convincing\", with neither being able to show any evidence of pre-Christian gods being worshipped in Early Modern Germany or being able to explain why there were no accounts of this witch-cult in between the Christianization and the trials themselves. Both Jarcke and Mone were politically conservative, and their depiction of the threatening witch-cult would have had parallels with the widespread conservative fear of secret societies as bringers of revolution and irreligion in early nineteenth-century Europe.\n\n\n=== Michelet, Gage, and Leland ===\n\nIn 1862, French historian Jules Michelet published La Sorcière (The Witch), in which he adapted the theory further. Michelet, a liberal who despised both the Roman Catholic Church and absolute monarchies, wrote that the Witch Cult had been practiced by the peasants in opposition to Roman Catholicism, which was practiced by the upper classes. He wrote that the witches had been mostly women (he greatly admired the feminine sex, once stating that it was the superior of the two), and that they had been great healers, whose knowledge was the basis of much of modern medicine. He believed that they worshiped the god Pan, who had become equated with the Christian figure of the Devil over time. When Michelet's La Sorcière was first published in France, it was, according to historian Ronald Hutton, \"greeted with silence from French literary critics, apparently because they recognized that it was not really history\".\nIn 1893, an American suffragist, Matilda Joslyn Gage, published Woman, Church and State, in which she wrote that in the prehistoric world, humanity had been matriarchal, worshiping a great Goddess, and that the witches of the witch cult had been pagan priestesses preserving this religion.\nIn 1897, the English scholar Karl Pearson, who was the professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London and an amateur historian and anthropologist, expanded on Michelet's theory. Pearson agreed with the theory of a prehistoric matriarchal society, and concurred with Gage that the witch-cult was a survival of it. Pearson theorized that during the Christian era, the religion began to emphasise the male deity, which was then equated with the Christian Devil. Pearson also wrote that Joan of Arc had been one of the last few priestesses of the religion. He was, however, unlike Michelet or Gage, opposed to the group and to Goddess worship in general, believing that it was primitive and savage.\nCharles Leland was an American folklorist and occultist who travelled around Europe in the latter 19th century and was a supporter of Michelet's theories. In 1899 he published Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, which he presented as having been a sacred text for Italian witches. It made no mention of a horned god, but did mention a male deity known as Lucifer, as well as a female deity, the goddess Diana. Leland's work would provide much of the inspiration for the neopagan witchcraft religion of Stregheria.\n\n\n== Impact of Margaret Murray ==\nIn 1915, Margaret Murray was an Egyptologist who worked under Sir Flinders Petrie at University College London. However, the outbreak of World War I had meant that many of their staff and students had abandoned scholarship to aid the British war effort, while archaeological excavation to Egypt had been rendered impossible. These events gave Murray more latitude in her studies, and she began to branch out and explore other interests. To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Aid Detachment of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to Saint-Malo in France. However, after being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury, Somerset, where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of Aramathea. Pursuing this interest, she published the paper \"Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance\" in the journal Ancient Egypt, although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised by scholars like Jessie Weston for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence.\nReturning to London, she began to work on the concept of witchcraft. Her first published work on the subject was an article in the academic journal Folklore in 1917, which she followed with a second in 1920. Further articles on the subject appeared in the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Scottish Historical Review.\n\n\n=== The Witch-Cult in Western Europe: 1921 ===\n\nIn The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. She drew a division between what she termed \"Operative Witchcraft\", which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and \"Ritual Witchcraft\", by which she meant \"the ancient religion of Western Europe\", a fertility-based faith that she also termed \"the Dianic cult\". She wrote that the cult had \"very probably\" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a \"Mother Goddess\" but that \"at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female\". In her thesis, Murray stated that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, \"manifest and incarnate\", to whom the witches offered their prayers. She wrote that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray described them as usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.\nMembers joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called \"admission ceremonies\"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also wrote that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptized into the faith. At the same time, she wrote that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into covens containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the \"Devil\" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a \"Grand Master\". According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.\nDescribing this witch-cult as \"a joyous religion\", she wrote that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the \"General Meeting of all members of the religion\" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. Murray said that these Esbats were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and that they were \"primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious.\" At Esbats, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches' paying homage to the deity, renewing their \"vows of fidelity and obedience\" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted; ceremonies and fertility rites took place; and the Sabbath concluded with feasting and dancing.\n\nDeeming Ritual Witchcraft to be \"a fertility cult\", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She wrote that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which neophytes write their names in blood, the sacrifice of animals, the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers, and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility.\nShe interpreted accounts of witches' shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of familiars were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into \"divining familiars\" used in divination and \"domestic familiars\" used in other magic rites.\nMurray asserted that paganism had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be \"practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community.\" She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarves, who continued to live in the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a position which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.\nLater historian Ronald Hutton commented that The Witch-Cult in Western Europe \"rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology\". He also noted that the book's tone was generally \"dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footned to a source, with lavish quotation.\" It was not a best seller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on \"Witchcraft\" for the Encyclopædia Britannica, and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1968.\n\n\n=== The God of the Witches: 1931 ===\nMurray followed this book with The God of the Witches in 1931; although similar in content, it was aimed at a mass market audience and published by the popular press Sampson Low. Whereas the tone in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe had been \"dry and academic, the second bubbles with enthusiasm\", as her language becomes \"emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology\"; in particular she refers repeatedly to the cult as \"the Old Religion\". In this work she \"cut out or toned down\" many of the assertions of her previous book which would have painted the cult in a bad light, for instance regarding animal and child sacrifice, and also omitted any mention of sex.\nIn this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the Horned God, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic. She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, writing that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, as well as the deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she wrote that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Writing that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration.\n\n\n=== The Divine King in England: 1954 ===\nIn 1954, she published The Divine King in England, in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the proposed that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she wrote that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice. She also wrote that a number of important figures who died violent deaths, such as Archbishop Thomas Becket, were killed as a replacement for the king. No academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters. It did however influence a few historical novels e.g. Philip Lindsay's The Devil and King John.\n\n\n=== Academic reception: 1921–63 ===\nUpon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including a number of significant scholars, albeit none of whom were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like Sir George Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although Hill later publicly regretted doing so. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book Witches. It was also adopted and championed by the archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge, marking his increasing estrangement from mainstream academia; in turn, Murray publicly defended his controversial theories regarding the chalk hill figures of Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. As a result, a commentator writing in 1962 could comment that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\", being widely accepted among \"educated people\".\nCanadian historian Elliot Rose suggested that the reason why Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\", including \"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. As Hilda Ellis Davidson noted; \"how refreshing and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.\"\n\nNevertheless, Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced at the time were largely critical. George L. Burr critically reviewed both of her initial books on the subject for the American Historical Review. In his review of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe he asserted that she was not acquainted with the \"careful general histories by modern scholars\" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. As Pagan studies scholar Catherine Noble later put it, \"Burr has hardly a kind word for Murray\".\nOne of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books specialising in the archival material which rejected Murray's ideas. Similarly, W.R. Halliday reviewed her work for the Folklore journal and exposed the flaws in her use of sources. E. M. Loeb criticised her in his review of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe for American Anthropologist. In Noble's words, \"There is no constructive criticism between peers here; it is a frontal attack on an author Loeb clearly believes has no place among published historians, at least on the topic of witchcraft.\"\nIn his 1962 work A Razor for a Goat, Rose asserted that Murray's books on the witch-cult \"contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning.\" He accepted that her case \"could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it.\" Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he asserts that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises her for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. In addition to this, he challenged Murray's assertion that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as \"a view grounded on ignorance alone\".\nSimpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics Murray's theories were permitted \"to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic.\" As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in the journal Folklore between Murray's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robbins' in 1963. However, she also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown, Ruth Tongue, or Enid Porter, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, as evidence that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folklore.\nMurray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but did react to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting on religious prejudice. Noble later stated that Murray \"repeatedly dismissed [her critics] in print as close-minded, bigoted, or uninformed.\"\n\n\n=== Academic reception: 1963–present ===\nMurray's work came to be increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. At this time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America began to publish in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion. Such critics of Murray included Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo.\nIn his 1971 book Religion and the Decline of Magic, English historian Keith Thomas dismissed Murray's thesis when he asserted that scholarship on the Early Modern witch trials had established that there was \"very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult\". Although accepting that when she first published her ideas, they were \"the best alternative\" to the dominant \"rationalist\" view of witchcraft as \"total delusion\", he stated that her conclusions were \"almost totally groundless\" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point. In his 1975 book Europe's Inner Demons, English historian Norman Cohn commented on the \"extraordinary\" manner in which Murray's theory had come to \"exercise considerable influence\" within scholarship. Cohn was nevertheless highly critical; he asserted that Murray's \"knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent.\" Furthermore, he added that her ideas were \"firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould.\" That same year, the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade, writing in the History of Religions journal, described Murray's work as \"hopelessly inadequate\" and full of \"numberless and appalling errors\". He added that from the perspective of a historian of religion, \"her use of comparative materials and, in general, the methods of Religionswissenschaft have been unfortunate.\"\n\nIn 1994, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson devoted a paper in the Folklore journal to the subject of \"Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why?\". She noted that the Murrayite theory was \"based on deeply flawed methods and illogical arguments\" and that the discipline of folkloristics had been damaged by its association with Murray, who had been appointed President of the Folklore Society. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray wrote that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' reports of having flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves.\nIn 1996, historian Diane Purkiss asserted that Murray's thesis was \"intrinsically improbable\" and that it \"commands little or no allegiance within the modern academy\". She nevertheless felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had committed \"ritual slaughter\" when setting up their own histories of witchcraft by condemning Murray's. In doing so, she identified a trend for them to contrast their own perceived methodologically sound and sceptical interpretations with Murray's \"feminised belief\" about the witch-cult, hence ignoring any theoretical considerations regarding the male-centric nature of their own perspectives.\nIn his 1999 book The Triumph of the Moon, Hutton asserted that Murray had treated her source material with \"reckless abandon\", in that she had taken \"vivid details of alleged witch practices\" from \"sources scattered across a great extent of space and time\" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Concurring with this assessment, historian Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander stated that \"Murray's use of sources in general is appalling\". They went on to assert that \"Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises.\" In his sociological study of the Early Modern witchcraft, Gary Jensen highlighted that Murray's work had been \"seriously challenged\" and that it did not take into account \"why it took so long for the heretic witch to be invented and targeted\", noting that had the Murrayite witch-cult been a reality, then it would have been persecuted throughout the Medieval and not just in the Early Modern period.\n\n\n== Later writers ==\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Neo-Pagan Heinrich Himmler organised a branch of the SS to undertake the largest survey of witch-hunt trial records in Europe ever taken, with the dual aim of using it as anti-Christian propaganda, to support his theory that the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous Völkisch Norse-Germanic nature religion, and as evidence for reconstructing that religion. This prompted Stuart Clark to dub the Nazi regime \"Europe's first and only 'pro-witch' government.\" One pamphlet, 1935's The Christian Witch-Craze, wrote that the witch-hunts were an attempt to exterminate \"Aryan womanhood\".\nIn 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds, theorised that the origins of the witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.\nWhile Murray's theory had received some negative critical attention at the time of its first publication, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that her books became best sellers, reaching a larger audience and thereby subsequently causing experts to decide that \"the Murray thesis had to be stopped once and for all\".\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSimpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the Encyclopædia Britannica made it accessible to \"journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers\", who adopted it \"enthusiastically\". It influenced the work of Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves.\n\n\n=== Influence on occultism and contemporary Paganism ===\nThe Murrayite thesis provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca.\nIn the 1950s, several British occultists wrote that they had found remnants of the surviving Witch Cult. The first of these was Gerald Gardner, who said he had discovered a coven of such witches - the New Forest Coven, in 1939. Gardner said that he was concerned that the religion would die out, and so initiated more members into it through his Bricket Wood coven. The tradition that he started became Gardnerian Wicca. The New Forest witch Sybil Leek made a similar assertion, stating that she followed the religion as many of her family had previously done, and a similar statement came from the Australian artist Rosaleen Norton, whose family had been of Welsh origin. Charles Cardell also asserted a hereditary lineage of the witch-cult, and he posited that the horned deity of the witches was known as Atho. Other Britons soon made statements that they were members of a long line of family Witches. Robert Cochrane did so, and ran a coven called the Clan of Tubal Cain; he inspired the founding of several movements, including the 1734 Tradition. Alex Sanders also made such a statement, and founded Alexandrian Wicca; however, Sanders turned out to be a Gardnerian initiate and had based Alexandrian ritual on Gardnerian Wicca. In 1974, E. W. Lidell said that the occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated into the witch-cult in 1899 or 1900, after being introduced to it through Allan Bennett, a Golden Dawn friend of his. Lidell continued by saying that the coven's High Priestess expelled Crowley for being \"a dirty minded, evilly disposed, vicious little monster\". No substantiating evidence has, however, been produced for this.\n\n\n=== Carlo Ginzburg and the benandanti ===\n\nFrom the 1960s Carlo Ginzburg documented the beliefs of a number of early modern groups of sorcerers, seers and healers. He wrote they were rooted in pre-Christian paganism, and credited Murray with a \"correct intuition\" in identifying the remnants of a pre-Christian 'religion of Diana', and in believing that witch-trial testimonies did at times represent actual or perceived experiences.\nIn the original Italian preface to I benandanti, published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, writing that although it contained \"a kernel of truth\", it had been \"formulated in a wholly uncritical way\", containing \"serious defects\". With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his \"Preface to the English Edition\", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that \"Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point.\" He added that although he rejected her ideas, there was a \"kernel of truth\" in Murray's thesis.\nSome historians have viewed Ginzburg's ideas as being related to Murray's; Hungarian historian Gábor Klaniczay stated that \"Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about the reality of the witches' Sabbath\" and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 \"reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults\". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade commented that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti \"does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis\", it did represent a \"well-documented case of the processus through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition.\" Historian of witchcraft Michael D. Bailey suggested that Ginzburg's work \"somewhat revived\" Murray's \"discredited notion of witchcraft representing an ancient fertility religion\".\nConversely, other scholars drew a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg; in 1975, Cohn stated that Ginzburg's discovery had \"nothing to do\" with Murray's witch-cult hypothesis. Echoing these views, in 1999 English historian Ronald Hutton stated that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually \"pretty much the opposite\" of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that \"ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages\" differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events. The folklorist Juliette Wood stated that while Ginzburg articulated a \"more sympathetic\" stance to Murray's ideas than other specialists in the witch trials, he \"does not propose anything approaching the pan-European cult which Murray advocated\".\n\n\n=== Sabina Magliocco and the ostension ===\nIn 2002 Sabina Magliocco theorized a middle way between Hutton's idea that pre-Christian elements in witchcraft were only legends, dreams or trance experiences and Murray's idea that there was an organized pagan witches' society, by stating that although being diffused as legends, witchcraft beliefs, as all the legends, \"occasionally become dramatic enactments known as \"ostension\"\".\nOstension, according to Magliocco, \"always derives from a pre-existing legend, the legend precedes the existence of its enactment, therefore even if a group decided to enact aspects of the legend of Diana/ Herodias, it would not have been a revival of pre-Christian paganism, but an attempt to act out certain ritual aspects described in the legends. Moreover, the more magical aspects from the trial reports—night flights on the backs of animals, ever-replenishing banquets, resurrection of dead livestock—could not have been achieved through ostension. We need to consider these as fantastical legend motifs, reports of experiences from trances or dreams, or both\".\nFurthermore, Magliocco specifies that the accused of witchcraft who reported pagan themes such as the Society of Diana and Herodias \"constituted only a small minority of all those accused of witchcraft\".\nBy taking the example of two women condemned as witches in Milan in 1390, Sibillia Zanni and Pierina de' Bugatis, she states that, even though \"we have no proof such a society ever existed, it is not inconceivable that a few inspired individuals might have decided to dramatize, once or repeatedly, the gatherings described in legends\" in Medieval and Early Modern Europe. A gathering based on legends of Diana and/or Herodias \"would probably have been secret and limited to the friends and associates of the creative instigators, who might well have been folk healers. One or more women might even have played the role of Diana or Herodias, presiding over the gathering and giving advice. Feasting, drinking and dancing might have taken place, and the women may have exchanged advice on matters of healing and divination\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nCult of Herodias\nHistory of Wicca\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "wikipedia_content": "\"Just Asking Questions\" (JAQ; known derisively as \"JAQing off\") is a pseudoskeptical tactic often used by conspiracy theorists to present false or distorted claims by framing them as questions. If criticized, the proponent of such a claim may then defend themselves by asserting they were merely asking questions which may upset the mainstream consensus. The name of the tactic is therefore derived from the typical response of \"I'm not saying it was necessarily a conspiracy; I'm just asking questions.\" In The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Steven Novella distinguishes JAQ from scientific skepticism by explaining that:\n\n[W]hen true scientists ask a question, they want an answer and will give due consideration to any possibilities. Deniers, on the other hand, will ask the same undermining questions over and over, long after they have been definitively answered. The questions—used to cast doubt—are all they are interested in, not the process of discovery they're meant to inspire.An early usage of the tactic can be found in Bertrand Russell's essay 16 Questions on the Assassination, which insinuated that American president John F. Kennedy was assassinated by someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald. JAQ as a tactic to justify pseudoarcheological claims was popularized by the Swiss author Erich von Däniken and the American TV show Ancient Aliens, and became further prevalent with the rise of the internet.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===",

        "title": "Gemstone File",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Gemstone File is a conspiracy theory document attributed to Bruce Porter Roberts. In 1975, \"A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File\" appeared and is generally attributed to Stephanie Caruana. The \"Key\" is purportedly a synopsis of Roberts' documents that presents a chronicle of interlocking conspiracies, including claims that world events since the 1950s were shaped by suppressed information, the names of supposed shooters of President John F. Kennedy, and suggested connections between a number of political assassinations which occurred within a relatively short time frame. Authors James McConnachie and Robin Tudge called it \"the original mega-conspiracy theory.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally distributed in 1975 by hand and mail in photocopy form, the Gemstone File has appeared in slightly revised form in Hustler magazine and on the Internet. Roberts, known only to Stephanie Caruana and conspiracy theorist Mae Brussell, purportedly began gathering information in the file when Howard Hughes stole his invention for processing synthetic rubies, hence the title \"Gemstone\". According to Gerald Carroll, Roberts was born in New York State on October 27, 1919, and died of lung cancer in San Francisco on July 16, 1976.\nFactsheet Five publisher Mike Gunderloy collected and distributed several versions of the Gemstone File. Gunderloy wrote that the original Gemstone File was simply a list of contributors to Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP), while the subsequent versions gradually linked various figures of the Watergate and Kennedy eras.\n\n\n== Outline ==\nThe Gemstone File proposes that Aristotle Onassis, Joseph P. Kennedy, and other prominent figures were involved in various schemes to forward a vast global conspiracy, involving the Mafia and corrupt politicians, brutal oil and drug cartels, rogue military operations, and more. It also posits that early in 1957, Aristotle Onassis had Howard Hughes kidnapped from his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow; that Hughes suffered a massive brain injury during the forcible kidnapping, and that Hughes was subsequently a virtual prisoner of Onassis on Skorpios and injected regularly with morphine, while Onassis took over the operation of Hughes's considerable financial affairs, including airlines and U.S. defense contracting.\nThe Gemstone File portrays Onassis as the main force behind the election of John F. Kennedy as president and, subsequently, Kennedy's assassination in 1963. According to the documents, Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination plan and was linked to the Central Intelligence Agency, and to Mafia connections in New Orleans, with Jimmy Fratianno, Johnny Roselli, and Eugene Brading as the real shooters.} The Gemstone papers claim that John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy were involved with the Mafia and Onassis, and when the Kennedy brothers attempted to break away, they were murdered.\n\n\n== Books ==\nThe Gemstone File, Jim Keith, ed. (1992, IllumiNet Press. 214 pages) Includes the Skeleton Key; an interview with Stephanie Caruana; excerpts from Mae Brussell's 2 1977-8 KLRB radio broadcasts on the Skeleton Key and Bruce Roberts' Gemstone File; Kiwi Gemstone; and articles by Jonathan Vankin, Robert Anton Wilson, Kerry Wendell Thornley, Ben G.

Includes Kiwi Gemstone, account of Danny Casolaro's mysterious death, Com-12 Briefing Documents, Interview with Stephanie Caruanaa, etc.\nThe Gemstone File: A Memoir by Stephanie Caruana (2006, Trafford Press, 480 pages) Contains an updated, expanded Skeleton Key, 2 related articles by Stephanie Caruana and Mae Brussell, and 220 edited pages from Bruce Roberts' original handwritten Gemstone File letters; the Kiwi Gemstone, and other items.\n\n\n== In fiction ==\nIn the television series La Femme Nikita, the Gemstone File documents the plans for world domination of Operations (also known as Paul Wolfe), the leading operative of Section 1, which involve the support of Saddam Hussein, a pawn in Operations' schemes. The former head of Section 1, Adrian, plans of revealing the Gemstone File first to George, head of Oversight, and then to the public in order to shatter Operations's bid for power, though Nikita ends up siding with Operations, as simulations predict world chaos and destruction should Hussein be removed from power.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Gemstone File and Freemasonry\nCopy of the Opal File",

        "wikipedia_content": "Biblical conspiracy theories posit that much of what is believed about the Bible is a deception created to suppress a secret or ancient truth. Such conspiracy theories may claim that Jesus really had a wife and children, or that a group such as the Priory of Sion has secret information about the true descendants of Jesus; some claim that there was a secret movement to censor books that truly belonged in the Bible, etc.\nThis subject should not be confused with deliberately fictional Bible conspiracy theories. A number of bestselling modern novels, the most popular of which was The Da Vinci Code, have incorporated elements of Bible conspiracy theories to flesh out their storylines, rather than to push these theories as actual suggestions.\n\n\n== Common theories ==\n\n\n=== Jesus-myth theory ===\n\nSome proponents of the Jesus-myth or Christ-myth theory consider that the whole of Christianity is a conspiracy. American author Acharya S (Dorothy Murdock) in The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold (1999) argues that Jesus and Christianity were created by members of various secret societies, mystery schools, and religions, that these people drew on numerous myths and rituals which existed previously, and that the church then constructed these ideas into Christianity by suppressing the originally intended understanding. In the 1930s British spiritualist Hannen Swaffer's home circle, following the teachings of the native-American spirit \"Silver Birch\", also claimed a Jesus-myth.\n\n\n=== Church suppression of reincarnation conspiracy ===\nSome New Age believers consider that Jesus taught reincarnation but the Christian Church suppressed it. Geddes MacGregor in Reincarnation in Christianity (1978) suggests that Origen's texts written in support of the belief in reincarnation somehow disappeared or were suppressed.\n\n\n=== Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail ===\nSome common hypotheses are that:\n\nMary Magdalene was one of the apostles of Jesus, possibly even the only disciple, but this was suppressed by the early Church.\nJesus had an intimate relationship with Mary Magdalene which may or may not have resulted in marriage or children; their continued bloodline is then said to be Christianity's deepest secret.\nThe Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln (1982) is seen by many as the source of that plotline in The Da Vinci Code.\n\n\n=== Resurrected Jesus as an impostor ===\nThe Gospel of Afranius, an atheistic Russian work that came out in English in 2022, proposes politically motivated gaslighting as the origin of the foundational Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\n\n\n== Books ==\nThe Gospel of Afranius\nThe Jesus Papers: Exposing the Greatest Cover-Up in History, Michael Baigent (2006)\nJesus the Magician: Charlatan or Son of God?, Morton Smith (1978)\nThe Jesus Dynasty, James Tabor (2006)\nJesus the Man: New Interpretations from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Barbara Thiering (1993)\nThe Jesus Scroll, Donovan Joyce (1972)\nHoly Blood, Holy Grail, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln (1982)\nThe Templar Revelation, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince (1997)\nThe Jesus Mysteries: Was the \"Original Jesus\" a Pagan God?, Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy (1999)\nThe Jesus Conspiracy: The Turin Shroud and the Truth About the Resurrection, Holger Kersten and Elmar R.

        "title": "Debunker",
        "wikipedia_content": "A debunker is a person or organization that exposes or discredits claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. The term is often associated with skeptical investigation of controversial topics such as UFOs, claimed paranormal phenomena, cryptids, conspiracy theories, alternative medicine, religion, exploratory or fringe areas of scientific, or pseudoscientific research.\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to \"debunk\" is defined as: \"to expose the sham or falseness of.\" The  New Oxford American Dictionary defines \"debunk\" as \"expose the falseness or hollowness of (a myth, idea, or belief)\".\nIf debunkers are not careful, their communications may backfire – increasing an audience's long-term belief in myths. Backfire effects can occur if a message spends too much time on the negative case, if it is too complex, or if the message is threatening.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe American Heritage Dictionary traces the passage of the words \"bunk\" (noun), \"debunk\" (verb) and \"debunker\" (noun) into American English in 1923 as a belated outgrowth of \"bunkum\". The first recorded use of the words was in 1828, apparently related to a poorly received \"speech for Buncombe County, North Carolina\" given by North Carolina representative Felix Walker during the 16th United States Congress (1819–1821).\nThe term \"debunk\" originated in a 1923 novel Bunk, by American journalist and popular historian W. E. Woodward (1874–1950), who used it to mean to \"take the bunk out of things\".\nThe term \"debunkery\" is not limited to arguments about scientific validity; it is also used in a more general sense at attempts to discredit any opposing point of view, such as that of a political opponent.\n\n\n== Notable debunkers ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nCicero debunked divination in his philosophical treatise De Divinatione in 44 BCE.\nSextus Empiricus debunked the claims of astrologers and dogmatic philosophers (c. 160 CE)\nLucian wrote a book named Alexander the False Prophet against mystic and oracle Alexander of Abonoteichus (c. 105 – c. 170 CE) who led the Glycon cult then widely popular in the Roman Empire. He described Alexander's alleged miracles as tricks, including the appearance of the god Glycon being an elaborate puppet. Lucian also describes him as using thuggery against critics to silence them, including himself.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nStephen Barrett founded Quackwatch and writes on medical quackery.\nAdam Conover hosted the television series Adam Ruins Everything which debunks several misconceptions.\nDorothy Dietrich is a professional magician and Houdini expert and historian.

He is known for criticising religion, pseudoscience, creationism, Hyperloop, Solar Roadways, etc.\nAlan Melikdjanian (Captain Disillusion) is a debunker of viral videos and hoaxes on the Internet, usually deconstructing them and explaining the post production techniques and software used to create the illusions.\nDonald Menzel was Philip Klass's predecessor in debunking UFOs.\nJoe Nickell writes regularly for the Skeptical Inquirer.\nPenn & Teller are an entertainment team who often demystify magic tricks and illusions.

Backfire effects occur when science communicators accidentally reinforce false beliefs by trying to correct them, a phenomenon known as belief perseverance.\nCook and Lewandowsky offer possible solutions to the backfire effects as described in different psychological studies. They recommend spending little or no time describing misconceptions because people cannot help but remember ideas that they have heard before. They write \"Your goal is to increase people's familiarity with the facts.\" They recommend providing fewer and clearer arguments, considering that more people recall a message when it is simpler and easier to read. \"Less is more\" is especially important because scientific truths can get overwhelmingly detailed; pictures, graphs, and memorable tag lines all help keep things simple.\nThe authors write that debunkers should try to build up people's egos in some way before confronting false beliefs because it is difficult to consider ideas that threaten one's worldviews (i.e., threatening ideas cause cognitive dissonance). It is also advisable to avoid words with negative connotations. The authors describe studies which have shown that people abhor incomplete explanations – they write \"In the absence of a better explanation, [people] opt for the wrong explanation\". It is important to fill in conceptual gaps, and to explain the cause of the misconception in the first place. The authors believe these techniques can reduce the odds of a \"backfire\" – that an attempt to debunk bad science will increase the audience's belief in misconceptions.\nThe Debunking Handbook, 2020, explains that \"backfire effects occur only occasionally and the risk of occurrence is lower in most situations than once thought\". The authors recommend to \"not refrain from attempting to debunk or correct misinformation out of fear that doing so will backfire or increase beliefs in false information\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe True Believer\nList of scientific skeptics\n\n\n== References ==",

Known jokingly internally as Operation Witch Doctor, the project was operational between 1949 and 1952. A conspiracy theory has circulated claiming that the Lynmouth Flood was caused by Project Cumulus. This claim is still ultimately unproven, and weather patterns have shown similar floods dating back to both the 18th and 19th centuries throughout Northern Wales and the UK.\n\n\n== Lynmouth disaster ==\n\nOn 16 August 1952, a severe flood occurred in the town of Lynmouth in north Devon. Nine inches (229 millimetres) of rain fell within twenty-four hours: \"Ninety million tonnes of water swept down the narrow valley into Lynmouth\" and the East Lyn River rose rapidly and burst its banks. Thirty-four people died and many buildings and bridges were seriously damaged.  According to the BBC, \"North Devon experienced 250 times the normal August rainfall in 1952.\"\nThe amount of rainfall cited by the BBC seems questionable. An article from the 1953 Geography Journal cited the rainfall levels to be high, but nothing close to the levels suggested by the BBC article from 2001. The dry weather leading up to the above-average rainfall is plenty to explain the flooding.\nComparable floods in the area have been recorded in the past, such as one in 1924. \nA conspiracy theory has circulated that the flood was caused by secret cloud seeding experiments conducted by the Royal Air Force. However, noting that the experiments were not secret, that the cloud seeding experiments were at the scale of individual clouds, and that the whole of the southwestern corner of the British Isles was affected by heavy rain at the time, the theory to whether the weather was impacted has been dismissed as \"preposterous\" by one weather expert Philip Eden.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 1952 Flood Disaster in Context, Exmoor National Park Authority\n\"Weather\", Royal Meteorological Society, July 1952.",

The tests and regulations for MLB baseballs were described in detail. He said that he did not expect to find any change from the manufacturing process that had been used for the previous 16 years or more.\nVarious baseball manufacturers in the United States also agreed that the theory is nonsense, as there are many quality checks in place.\nThe stitchers interviewed did not even know what a juiced ball was. On the other hand, there is an argument that their livelihood depends on baseball sales, which may increase if the balls are juiced.\nMany pitchers felt that the balls became harder and traveled faster. Some pitchers performed their own tests. Kenny Rogers found that the ball in the center of each baseball was made of rubber, rather than the old cork. Billy Koch found that when dropped from the same height, the rubber balls from 2000 bounced 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) higher than rubber balls from 1999.\nIn 2000, Frank Deford, a writer for Sports Illustrated, interviewed Sandy Alderson, an MLB vice president, to discuss the possibility of a conspiracy by MLB to doctor the balls. Alderson denied this possibility, and Deford also discredited it as a conspiracy theory.\nSome players in the 2002 World Series complained that the balls were juiced after an 11–10 game. Alderson denied these allegations.\nThe \"Juiced Ball Theory\" receded in popularity since the exposure of widespread use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs by professional baseball players during the same period, providing a more likely explanation for the increased numbers of home runs.\n\n\n== Late 2010s ==\nDuring the 2017 MLB season, a record-breaking 6,104 home runs were hit in the major leagues, surpassing the record of 5,693 set in 2000, during the height of the steroid era. Beginning that season, several commentators pointed out the surge in home run rate and pointed to the 2015 All-Star Break as a likely beginning point for a change in baseball composition, if there was one. In an article for The Ringer in 2017, Ben Lindbergh and Mitchel Lichtman tested three dozen game-used balls and found evidence that in 2015 the balls became slightly bouncier, and in 2016, the balls became slightly smaller and with lower seams. New York Mets manager Terry Collins said, \"The seams on the ball are definitely lower. I think that’s why everybody is having blister problems all of a sudden. And there’s no question that the ball is harder.\" The following month San Francisco Giants pitcher Johnny Cueto stated that he strongly suspected that a \"tighter\" baseball was the cause of the first blisters in his career. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred repeatedly denied allegations that modern baseballs are \"juiced\" throughout 2017, maintaining that baseballs continue to be tested and fall within their designated measurable limits.\nIn March 2018, research by FiveThirtyEight's Rob Arthur found evidence of significant difference in the composition of the cores of baseballs produced after 2015 and before. Several months later, the MLB received the results of its own scientific study, looking into the increase in home run rate since 2015, and acknowledged that the increase was due, at least in part, to \"a change in the aerodynamic properties of the baseball\". The report suggested several steps to address the issue. Researchers Brian J. Love and Michael L. Burns, writing for The Conversation, identified other factors that could be contributing to the changing baseball composition, including lowering quality of cork supplied worldwide due to climate change, and new standards for humidity control for storing baseballs at MLB stadiums.\nIn June 2018 it was announced that MLB had teamed up with a private equity firm to purchase Rawlings, the longtime manufacturers of the baseballs used by MLB, for a reported $395 million. Regarding the decision to purchase Rawlings, Chris Marinak, the executive vice president for strategy, technology and innovation for MLB said, \"We are particularly interested in providing even more input and direction on the production of the official ball of Major League Baseball, one of the most important on-field products to the play of our great game.\" The purchase of Rawlings by MLB has fueled fan concerns over a possible conspiracy by MLB to boost the offense as a way to combat low attendance and TV ratings.\nIn 2019, the juiced ball theory came to the forefront once again, as the major leagues were on pace to hit 6,668 home runs as of the All-Star break, which would smash the 2017 record of 6,105. The Triple-A-level minor leagues also saw a sharp increase in home runs, 58% over the previous year, after switching to the same ball used in the majors. Pitcher Emilio Pagan said, \"To see the big league ball fly for the first time—it's pretty mind-blowing. Guys that had never seen it before, well, it's hard to put into words how much farther the big league ball goes, because it's spun tighter.\"\nShortly before the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Manfred acknowledged the difference in the balls, saying, \"Our scientists that have been now studying the baseball more regularly have told us that this year the baseball has a little less drag. [...] We are trying to understand exactly why that happened and build out a manufacturing process that gives us a little more control over what's going on. But you have to remember that our baseball is a handmade product and there's gonna be variation year to year.\" All-Star Game starting pitcher Justin Verlander said that the balls used in MLB games are \"a fucking joke\" and that he believes \"100 percent\" that the league has implemented juiced balls to increase offense.\nAfter years of complaints from numerous pitchers around the game, before the 2022 season Manfred said, \"Every baseball that's in use in '22 was produced under the new manufacturing process...and in fact, the process has resulted in a more consistent baseball.\". However, a Business Insider investigative report found that three different balls were used in the 2022 season. In particular, the \"Goldilocks\" ball (one that had increased exit velocities and launch relative to its peers), which was typically used in the All Star Game or postseason games, was found to have been used in multiple New York Yankees games. As Business Insider said, \"Finding these balls might, in any other year, seem unremarkable. But this season, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was in the midst of an historic home run chase. On October 4, at the Rangers' Globe Life Field, Judge broke the American League record for home runs, with 62.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlack Sox Scandal\nMajor League Baseball scandals\nDoping in baseball\nMitchell Report\nBiogenesis scandal\n1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Monita Secreta",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Monita Secreta (also known as: Secret Instructions of the Jesuits, or the Secret Instructions of the Society of Jesus) is an alleged code of instructions from Claudio Acquaviva, the fifth general of the Society of Jesus, to its various superiors which claims to lay down methods to expand the power and influence of the Jesuit Order. Some Scholars regard the document as an anti-Jesuit forgery.\n\n\n== Summary of Contents ==\nAccording to the Monita, Jesuits are to use every means at their disposal to acquire wealth for the order. For instance, Jesuits are encouraged to entice promising young men to enter the order and endow it with their estates; rich widows are to be cajoled and dissuaded from remarriage. Every means is to be used for the advancement of Jesuits to bishoprics or other ecclesiastical dignities and to discredit the members of other orders, while the world is to be persuaded that the Society is animated by the purest and least interested motives: the reputation of those who quit it is to be assailed and maligned in every way.\n\n\n== History ==\nScholars consider the Monita to be the work of one Jerome Zahorowski, a Pole, who, having been a member of the Society, had been expelled for disciplinary matters in 1613. They were first published in Kraków in 1615, purporting to be a translation from the Spanish, and were printed in the same city in 1614. Various stories were told regarding their discovery; they were most often associated with Duke Christian of Brunswick, despite the fact that he would have been only 15 years old at the time of their initial publication. The place where they were found was variously set down as Paderborn, Prague, Liège, Antwerp, Glatz, and on board a captured East Indiaman.\nAttempts were likewise made at various times, as late even as 1783, to excite interest in the work as the result of a new discovery; there was also an undated edition, in the early nineteenth century, which professes to issue from the Propaganda Press, and to be authenticated by the testimonies of various Jesuit authorities. However, they are attributed to a general, \"Felix Aconiti\", who is completely unknown in the Annals of the Society of Jesus. The censor who purportedly approves the publication bears the name \"Pasquinelli\", while the titles which, it is alleged, should ensure the esteem of men in general for the Society, include all the crimes and abominations of every kind—immoralities, conspiracies, murders, and regicides—which the Jesuits' bitterest enemies have attributed to it.\n\n\n== Debate about authenticity ==\nAmongst those who have argued that the Monita are a hoax are Bishop Lipski of Cracow (1616), Bernhard Duhr in his Jesuiten Fablen, Fra Paolo Sarpi, the historian of the Council of Trent and Antoine Arnauld and the \"Nouvelles Ecclesiastiques\"; plus anti-Jesuits such as the Jansenists Henri de Saint-Ignace and Blaise Pascal, von Lang, Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, Friedrich (the author of Janus), Huber, and Reusch, as well as the Protestant historian Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler. In the British House of Commons, during the debates on Catholic Emancipation, the fraudulent character of the Monita was acknowledged by more than one speaker, while the authorities of the British Museum and likewise the French bibliographer M. Barbier, agree in describing the work as \"apocryphal\".\nAnglican Bishop of London Henry Compton was strongly opposed to Roman Catholicism, and in 1669 published an English translation of The Secret Instructions.\nA defense was offered by Richard Frederick Littledale, opponent to Roman Catholicism,  in his article \"Jesuits\", in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1881.  He claimed that the work is \"both caricature and libel\", but pleaded nevertheless that it was substantially true, since its author, \"a shrewd and keen observer\", having noticed how Jesuits actually worked, deduced from his observations the rules by which they were guided.\nAs against this case, John Gerard, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia denies the authorship arguing that the official rules and constitutions of the Jesuits contradict these supposed instructions, for they expressly prohibit the acceptance of ecclesiastical dignities by its subjects, unless compelled by papal authority, and from the days of the founder, St. Ignatius Loyola, the Society has impeded such promotion. Gerard also argues that in many cases, genuine private instructions from the Jesuit general to subordinate superiors have fallen into hostile hands, which in many cases are found to give instructions directly contrary to those in the Monita.\nJames Bernauer draws comparisons between the Monita Secreta to the later no less libelous, discredited anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

        "title": "Islamophobic trope",
        "wikipedia_content": "Islamophobic tropes, also known as anti-Muslim tropes, are sensational reports misrepresentations, or fabrications, regarding Muslims as an ethnicity or Islam as a religion.\nSince the 20th century, malicious allegations about Muslims have increasingly occurred a recurred as a motif in Islamophobic tropes, often taking the form of libels, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories. These tropes typically portray Muslims as violent, oppressive, or inherently extremist, with some also featuring the denial or trivialization of historical injustices against Muslim communities. These stereotypes have contributed to discrimination, hate crimes, and systemic marginalization of Muslims throughout history.\nDuring the colonial era, European powers advanced the stereotype of Muslims as inherently despotic and backward to legitimize imperial rule over Muslim-majority lands. These tropes often depicted Islam as incompatible with modernity and democracy, reinforcing policies of cultural suppression and economic exploitation.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Islamophobic narratives evolved into modern conspiracy theories, particularly the notion that Muslims are attempting to “Islamize” the Western world or that they constitute a secret fifth column plotting against non-Muslim societies. The rise of Islamist extremist groups in recent decades has been used to justify broad generalizations about Muslims as inherently violent or sympathetic to terrorism. These tropes have fueled policies such as surveillance of Muslim communities, restrictions on religious practices (including hijab bans), and outright bans on Muslim immigration in some countries.\nMost contemporary Islamophobic tropes involve either the exaggeration of violence committed by Muslims or the denial or trivialization of violence against Muslims. Common examples include the claim that Muslims “play the victim” to manipulate public perception, or that Islam is uniquely responsible for terrorism while ignoring or downplaying violence committed by non-Muslims. In recent years, the denial or justification of human rights abuses against Muslims, such as the persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar or the internment of Uyghurs in China, has been a key component of Islamophobic discourse.\n\n\n== Tropes ==\n\n\n=== White genocide conspiracy theory ===\n\nSince the early 21st century, particularly following the European migrant crisis of 2015, the White genocide conspiracy theory has increasingly targeted Muslims. The theory falsely claims that Muslim immigration and higher birth rates are part of a coordinated effort to replace White populations in Europe and North America. This narrative is often fueled by far-right figures, who depict Muslim migrants as an existential threat to Western civilization, framing their presence as an “invasion” rather than natural demographic shifts caused by conflict, globalization, and labor migration.\nMuch of this rhetoric is rooted in fears about cultural and religious transformation, with Islam portrayed as inherently incompatible with Western values. Proponents of the conspiracy theory often link it to broader Islamophobic tropes, including the belief that Muslims refuse to assimilate and aim to impose Islamic law (sharia) on non-Muslim societies. Some variations of the theory claim that Western political elites are deliberately enabling mass Muslim immigration to dilute national identities, a narrative echoed in slogans such as the “Great Replacement,” popularized by figures like French writer Renaud Camus.\nBelief in the White genocide theory has been linked to acts of terrorism targeting Muslim communities. Notable incidents include the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where the attacker explicitly cited the Great Replacement theory in his manifesto before killing 51 worshippers. Other violent attacks motivated by similar ideology include the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting and the 2021 London, Ontario truck attack, both of which targeted Muslim families.\n\n\n=== Muslims as violent figures ===\nThe stereotype that Muslims are inherently violent or predisposed to terrorism is a common Islamophobic trope, often used to justify discrimination, surveillance, and restrictive policies against Muslim communities. This belief is frequently reinforced through selective reporting, media bias, and decontextualized interpretations of Islamic texts. The trope falsely portrays Islam as a uniquely violent religion, despite historical and contemporary violence committed by individuals of various religious and ideological backgrounds.\nStudies have shown that terrorist attacks committed by Muslims receive far more media coverage than those by non-Muslims, contributing to the perception that Islam is uniquely linked to violence. Political leaders have also played a role in spreading this narrative, with figures such as former U.S. President Donald Trump advocating for a Muslim ban by citing terrorism concerns, despite the majority of terrorist attacks in the U.S. being carried out by far-right extremists.\nThis trope has justified increased surveillance and profiling of Muslim communities. The NYPD's post-9/11 surveillance program specifically targeted Muslims, monitoring mosques, Muslim-owned businesses, and student groups without evidence of criminal activity.. \nThis trope has been used to justify discriminatory policies targeting Muslims worldwide. In India, Hindu nationalist rhetoric frequently frames Muslims as violent “invaders,” fueling religious riots and lynchings of Muslims accused of eating beef or engaging in “love jihad” (a conspiracy theory that Muslim men seek to convert Hindu women through marriage). In China, the Chinese government has justified the internment of over a million Uyghur Muslims in so-called “re-education” camps by labeling them as security threats and extremists.\n\n\n=== Taqiyya claims ===\nThe taqiyya trope is a widespread Islamophobic misrepresentation that falsely claims Muslims have a religious obligation to deceive non-Muslims. This conspiracy theory is often used to argue that Muslims cannot be trusted, particularly in political, legal, and security contexts. The trope has been widely spread by far-right figures, anti-Muslim activists, and some political leaders to justify discrimination against Muslims and opposition to their participation in public life.\nThe Islamic concept of taqiyya originates from early Islamic history and refers to a religious dispensation allowing Muslims to conceal their faith when facing extreme persecution or mortal danger. Historically, it was primarily practiced by Shia Muslims in situations where revealing their religious beliefs could result in death or oppression. Despite its limited historical application, Islamophobic discourse has distorted taqiyya into a blanket accusation that all Muslims are permitted—or even required—to lie to non-Muslims for strategic advantage.\nThe taqiyya trope has been weaponized in political discourse, particularly in Western countries, to cast doubt on the sincerity of Muslim politicians, activists, and community leaders. This claim has been used to justify exclusionary policies and public suspicion toward Muslims in politics, including opposition to the appointment of Muslim public officials in the United States and Europe.\nThe trope has also been widely circulated on social media and far-right websites, where it is used to dismiss any peaceful or conciliatory statements by Muslim individuals as deceptive. Islamophobic groups such as Britain First, ACT for America, and the Identitarian movement have promoted taqiyya as proof that Muslims are waging a “stealth jihad” to infiltrate Western institutions.\nBelief in the taqiyya trope has fueled hate crimes and vigilante violence against Muslims. In 2015, an anti-Muslim extremist in the U.S. cited taqiyya as a justification for harassing Muslim store owners, claiming they were “lying about being peaceful.” In 2017, far-right groups in Germany spread the false claim that Muslim refugees were using taqiyya to disguise their true extremist beliefs, leading to increased attacks on asylum seekers.\n\n\n=== Islam oppresses women ===\n\nThe Islam oppresses women trope is a widespread Islamophobic stereotype that portrays Muslim women as universally subjugated and oppressed by Islamic teachings and Muslim men. This narrative is frequently used to justify discriminatory policies, foreign interventions, and anti-Muslim sentiment, often ignoring the diverse experiences of Muslim women and the role of colonialism, geopolitics, and socio-economic factors in shaping gender dynamics in Muslim-majority societies.\nThe trope has historical roots in Orientalist discourse, where European colonial powers framed Muslim societies as inherently patriarchal to justify intervention and control. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European colonial authorities used the narrative of “saving” Muslim women from oppression to rationalize imperial expansion in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This rhetoric has persisted into modern times, with Western political leaders frequently invoking the supposed oppression of Muslim women to justify policies ranging from immigration bans to military interventions.\nA key aspect of this misrepresentation is the portrayal of Islamic dress, particularly the hijab, niqab, or burqa, as symbols of forced submission. While some Muslim women face coercion in specific contexts, many others freely choose to wear these garments for cultural, religious, or personal reasons. The assumption that all Muslim women who cover themselves are oppressed disregards their agency and ignores the fact that modest dress exists across many religious traditions, including Christianity and Judaism. \nWestern media disproportionately highlights cases of gender-based violence in Muslim-majority countries while downplaying similar issues in non-Muslim societies. Honor killings, forced marriages, and domestic violence are framed as intrinsic to Islam, despite Islam's prohibition of all three acts and the prevalence of these crimes across cultures and religions worldwide.\nThe trope has led to policies that allegedly discriminate against Muslim women. In France, Belgium, and Switzerland, bans on full face coverings (such as the burqa, not including the hijab) restrict Muslim women's autonomy.  In India, Hindu nationalist rhetoric has targeted Muslim personal laws, portraying them as oppressive to Muslim women while simultaneously enacting discriminatory policies against Muslim communities, such as the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act.\nIn Western countries, Muslim women who wear headscarves are disproportionately targeted in hate crimes. Studies in the U.S., U.K., and Canada show that visibly Muslim women face higher rates of harassment and violence compared to Muslim men. The assumption that Muslim women need “saving” has also fueled Islamophobic discrimination in workplaces and schools, where Muslim women have been denied jobs, education, or public services due to their attire.\nFar-right groups and anti-Muslim activists frequently weaponize this trope to push anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies. In Europe and North America, nationalist movements have framed Muslim men as a threat to women's safety. This narrative gained traction after the 2015 European migrant crisis, when far-right groups exaggerated or fabricated stories about Muslim migrants sexually assaulting European women to justify restrictive immigration policies.\nSimilarly, far-right politicians and media outlets have promoted the trope of “Muslim grooming gangs” in the U.K., selectively amplifying cases involving Muslim perpetrators while downplaying or ignoring similar crimes committed by non-Muslims.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslamophobia\nAnti-Palestinianism\nViolence against Muslims in Burma\nPersecution of Uyghurs in China\nPallywood\nAnti-Muslim violence\nAntisemitism\nAntisemitic tropes\nPersecution of Muslims\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Contested US Presidential elections",
        "wikipedia_content": "Contested US Presidential elections involve serious allegations by top officials that the election was \"stolen.\" Such allegations appeared in 1824, 1876, 1912, 1960, 2000, and 2020.  Typically, the precise allegations change over time.\n\n\n== 1800 Presidential Election ==\n\nIn 1800, the Republican Party won the election and intended for party leader Thomas Jefferson to be president and New York politician Aaron Burr to be vice president. Both men ended up tied in the electoral college, but Burr wanted the job. The decision went to the House where the Federalists were powerful enough to stop Jefferson. Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton was a long-time foe of Jefferson but he deeply distrusted Burr.  Hamilton helped arrange for Jefferson to be elected president and Burr vice president. A constitutional amendment was passed to prevent similar confusion. In 1804, Burr killed Hamilton in a duel.\n\n\n== 1824 Presidential Election ==\n\nIn 1824, political parties were very weak, and the voters had the choice of four candidates: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. Jackson had won the popular and electoral vote, but not the majority. According to the Constitution, the House of Representatives had to vote among the top three. Henry Clay was now out of the running, but as Speaker of the House, he played a major role in the decision. He helped Adams win, and Adams rewarded him by appointing him as Secretary of State. To a friend, Clay explained that Jackson's militarism threatened American democracy:\"As a friend of Liberty, and to the permanence of our institutions, I cannot consent…by contributing to the election of a military chieftain, to give the strongest guarantee that this republic will march in the fatal road which has conducted every other republic to ruin.\" \nJackson was livid: \"The Judas of the West has closed the contract and will receive the thirty pieces of silver. His end will be the same.\" Jackson cried foul, believing the election was stolen by a \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Clay. He ran again and defeated Adams in 1828, using partisan rhetoric that Robert V. Remini says was, \"almost totally devoid of truth.\"\n\n\n== 1876 Presidential Election ==\n\nIn 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House by a partisan special Congressional commission. The result remains among the most disputed to this day. Although it is not disputed that Democrat Samuel J. Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, there were wide allegations of electoral fraud, election violence, and other disfranchisement of predominantly Republican Black voters. After a first count of votes, Tilden had won 184 electoral votes to Hayes's 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved. In Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, both parties reported their candidate to have won the state. In Oregon, one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for having been an \"elected or appointed official.\" The question of who should have been awarded those 20 electoral votes remains in dispute among historians, with most suggesting the Republicans were guilty.\n\n\n== 1912 Presidential Election ==\n\nIn 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt made sure the Republicans Party nominated his close friend William Howard Taft for president. Taft won, however Roosevelt was dissatisfied and challenged Taft for the 1912 nomination. Roosevelt accused Taft of \"stealing \" the Republican nomination. Roosevelt thereupon ran a third party ticket, allowing Democrat Woodrow Wilson to win. According to Lewis L. Gould,    Roosevelt saw Taft as the agent of \"the forces of reaction and of political crookedness\"....Roosevelt had become the most dangerous man in American history, said Taft, \"because of his hold upon the less intelligent voters and the discontented.\"  The Republican National Committee, dominated by the Taft forces, awarded 235 delegates to the president and 19 to Roosevelt, thereby ensuring Taft's renomination....Firm in his conviction that the nomination was being stolen from him, Roosevelt....told cheering supporters that there was \"a great moral issue\" at stake....\"Fearless of the future; unheeding of our individual fates; with unflinching hearts and undimmed eyes; we stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!\"\n\n\n== 2000 Presidential Election ==\n\nOn election night, it was unclear who had won, with the state of Florida still undecided. The final returns showed that Republican George W. Bush had won Florida by 537 votes out of six million cast. Democrat Al Gore was allowed by state law to demand recounts in selected counties. They wanted recounts in Democratic strongholds as it was predicted that votes had been miscounted in these counties. Republicans sued on the grounds the narrow recount unfairly ignored voters in other counties. A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5–4 Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore, which accepted the Republican argument, ended the recount, and left Bush the winner by 500 votes. Following the announcement of the Supreme Court's decision, Gore stated that \"Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken. Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court’s decision, I accept it. I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\" Despite objections from some Democrats, Gore (acting in his capacity as President of the Senate) presided over the certification of Bush's victory on January 6, 2001.\n\n\n== 2020 Presidential Election ==\n\nThe stolen election conspiracy theory claims that the 2020 United States presidential election was \"stolen\" from Donald Trump, who lost to Joe Biden. It serves to justify attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, including the January 6 United States Capitol Protest. A particular variant of it is the \"Soros stole the election\" conspiracy theory that claims that George Soros stole the election from Trump. Polls conducted since the aftermath of the 2020 election have consistently shown that majority of Republicans believe that the election was stolen from Trump. There was in fact the largest spike in voters between two consecutive presidential elections on record, only for the number of democrat voters to decline again in 2024. This spike came heavily at the end of election night, when a reportedly large amount of mail in ballots was counted in almost every swing state, changing the results of an election that many republicans went to sleep believing they had won. This was just the popular vote, so the suspicion revolving around the 2020 election ignited with many people hoping for further investigation on the electoral votes, including President Trump himself. Donald Trump's legal teams brought a variety of legal challenges to the results in several swing states, however these failed to alter the outcome of the election and were generally considered meritless by the judges who heard the suits. These challenges included an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear argument regarding three petitions brought by the Trump campaign.\nOne aspect of President Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election was an attempt to impeach the credibility of various companies involved in election administration. With no way to prove that the voting machines' programming was dubious or inconsistent, President Trump was unable to gain any traction in a legal battle against them. Some of the media companies which editorialized in favor of Trump were later sued for defamation by companies implicated in their reporting, including Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Smartmatic's lawsuit against Fox News remains active. On April 18, 2023, Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News announced a settlement in that case worth $787,500,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota\nList of conspiracy theories\nAmerican election campaigns in the 19th century\nElection denial movement in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nArgersinger, Peter H. \"New perspectives on election fraud in the Gilded Age.\" Political Science Quarterly (1985) 100#4 pp. 669–687.\nBaum, Dale, and James L.

        "title": "Christian fundamentalism and conspiracy theories",
        "wikipedia_content": "Since the early twentieth century there has been a significant overlap between Christian fundamentalism and millennialism in the United States and belief in false conspiracy theories, primarily the New World Order conspiracy theory, QAnon, and COVID-19 conspiracy theories, which are frequently perceived to represent fulfilment of Christian eschatology. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, in the book The New World Order, American evangelical charismatic televangelist Pat Robertson claimed that a secret one-world government has existed in the world led by Freemasonry and the Illuminati, in collaboration with Jewish bankers. One of the recurring subjects of Christian fundamentalist conspiracy theorists is the accusation of homosexual people of a gay agenda and of being responsible for social problems. The QAnon conspiracy movement, which originated in 2017 found a loyal following among Christian fundamentalists particularly concerned with the search for signs of the end times.  Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which depicted New Age practices, modern feminism, and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity, has been criticized as being a possible influence for QAnon. \nAdherence to conspiracy theories is particularly important in fundamentalist evangelical churches. Some pastors have explained this phenomenon with the distrust of expertise, which encourages citizens to challenge established authority figures. Others have described the mechanism of faith as \"[mutating] into vulnerability to conspiracy theories\" as well as apocalyptic narratives and Christian nationalism playing roles.\nAccording to a 2018 survey by LifeWay Research for the Wheaton College Billy Graham Center, 46% of self-identified evangelicals and 52% of evangelicals by belief believe that mainstream media spreads fake news. A 2022 study among Polish Roman Catholics found a positive correlation between religious fundamentalism and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nOutlets such as Christianity Today and Religion News Service have covered the movement's impact among congregations.\nIn 2017, Ed Stetzer wrote that Christians should repent of spreading false conspiracy theories and fake news online, which he says \"directly violates Scripture's prohibition from bearing false witness against our neighbors\". He argued that \"The Seth Rich conspiracy theory is a textbook example of false witness... Without seriously defending their claims, conservative Christians across the country accused their neighbor of murder.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarack Obama religion conspiracy theories\nVaccines and religion\nAnti-intellectualism\nBlood libel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nFenster, Mark (1999).

        "title": "Epsilon Team",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Epsilon Team (Greek: Ομάδα Έψιλον, romanized: Omada Epsilon) is an alleged secret society that appears in Greek modern folklore, conspiracy theories and ufology. The team was first described in a 1977 book, and supposedly consists of prominent Greek people who possess secret knowledge of extraterrestrial origin. Beginning in the 1980s, literature about the society became infused with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, placing the Epsilon Team in a cosmic battle against the Jews. The body of beliefs related to the Epsilon Team has been labeled epsilonism, and those who subscribe to it have been labeled epsilonists.\n\n\n== History ==\nEpsilon is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, and has a modern history as a symbol for freedom and Greece. It was notably used in this capacity during the Greek War of Independence. A precursor to the epsilonists was Spyridon Nagos, a Freemason and socialist who in the early 20th century envisioned a secret society of high-ranking Greeks, working in secret to benefit their country.\nThe originator of what became the modern Epsilon Team mythology was the author George Lefkofrydis. Inspired by Plutarch's text On the E at Delphi, he began to develop his theories in the 1960s. In 1977, he published the book Spaceship Epsilon: Aristotle's Organon: The Researcher, where he claimed to have discovered hidden messages in Aristotle's Organon. According to Lefkofrydis, the text reveals that Aristotle was an extraterrestrial from the star Mu in the constellation Lagos (Lepus/Rabbit). Lefkofrydis described the existence of a secret society of influential Greeks, who had extraterrestrial knowledge stemming from Aristotle, and who worked to protect the interests of the Greek people. Lefkofrydis' book was quickly withdrawn from publication, but its theories were developed further by others.\nThe conspiracy theory became better known in Greece around 1997 through a number of books and magazine articles. The word epsilonism was established as a term for the general phenomenon, and is usually used by people who disapprove of it. The Delphic Epsilon, which can be found on ancient Greek monuments but also on objects from the Inca civilisation, was established as the symbol of the Epsilon group.\nThe most prominent epsilonist writers in the 1980s and 1990s were Ioannis Fourakis, Anestis S. Keramydas, Dimosthenis Liakopoulos and Georgios Gkiolvas. Fourakis is generally considered to have coined the name Epsilon Team (Greek: Ομάδα Έψιλον, romanized: Omada Epsilon), and was also prominent in fusing epsilonism with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. In Fourakis' works, the Greeks are presented as being of extraterrestrial origin, associated with the Olympian gods, and part of an ancient cosmic war against the Jews. Fourakis predicts a revival of Hellenic culture and religion, which will happen through Greek Orthodox Christianity. In 1996, the former merchant navy officer Keramydas published the book Omada E, which went on to become a bestseller. He claimed to be a member of the secret society and emphasised the racial, anti-Semitic and pro-Orthodox angle, and added that the Jews also were of extraterrestrial origin. In the 2000s, the phenomenon became the subject of various weblogs, websites and online discussion forums. The Greek politician and television personality Kyriakos Velopoulos published the book Epsilonism: Epsilon Team in English in 2010.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe phenomenon, although fringe, is relatively  well known in Greece, and has had an impact on the conspiracy theory milieu and popular culture. It is mainly popular within some right-wing anti-Semitic circles and as a fringe phenomenon among conservative Orthodox Christians. It is also present within circles that seek to fuse Christianity with spiritual Hellenicity, notably the magazine Daulos. Among Greek neopagans the phenomenon is generally ridiculed.\n\n\n== Members and organisations ==\nPeople who have been named in epsilonist literature as members include Aristotle Onassis, Alexander Onassis, Spyridon Marinatos, the publisher Ioannis Passas, the mathematician Constantin Carathéodory, the general C. Nikolaidis, the physicist Kosta Tsipis, the mayor of Athens Antonis Tritsis, the Greek-American George Tsantes who was murdered by the 17 November Group, Alexandros Bodosakis, Dimitris Liantinis and the astronomer Konstantínos Chasapis.\nSeveral groups and individuals have claimed to represent the Epsilon Team themselves. The most publicised event occurred in October 2015, when five men were detained for the bombings of the Bank of Greece in Kalamata and the statue of Constantine XI Palaiologos in Mystras. The men belonged to a terrorist group called Team Epsilon, which also possessed a large number of explosives and firearms, and had plans for further attacks. The arrested proclaimed themselves to be pagans and claimed that their group aimed to \"take down the conspiracy inflicted on Greece by the banks and by Orthodox Christianity\". They had spray-painted the recognised sign of the Epsilon Team, the Delphic double \"E\", at the locations of their bombings.\nThe Club \"E\" Epsilon, led by the former professional marathon runner Aristotelis Kakogeorgiou, does not want to be associated with the Epsilon Team conspiracy theories. According to Kakogeorgiou, his organisation was founded in 1962 and the E stands for \"Ellínon\" (\"Greeks\"). It is open to people of all races and religions, and does not subscribe to anti-Semitism or the eschatological beliefs of epsilonism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient astronauts\nHellenocentrism\nUFO religion\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKourdis, Evangelos (2016). \"The Velopoulos-Liakopoulos Phenomenon.

        "wikipedia_content": "The Bauer 5GBioShield, usually shortened to 5GBioShield, is a fraudulent device which was claimed to protect against radiation from 5G mobile networks. The device was invented by clinical pharmacist Jacques Bauer and former scientist Ilija Lakicevic and marketed by alternative medicine activist Sacha Stone. The product, which was sold for approximately £330 through an affiliate marketing scheme, was found to be composed of a normal USB thumb drive and a sticker. As of April 26, 2022, The official website is no longer online. British Trading Standards officials determined that the device was a scam.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe manufacturers claim that: \"Through a process of quantum oscillation the 5G BioShield USB Key balances and reharmonizes the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wifi, tablets, etc.\"\nThe device is simply a common USB thumb drive containing marketing documents and usage instructions. The USB device is housed in a clear perspex block imprinted with a stylized version of St George slaying a dragon, as based on a medal originally made by William Wyon for Albert, Prince Consort.\nLakicevic, the co-inventor of the product, describes the device as containing a \"new energy\" embedded in a sticker, and that the USB stick is merely a carrier and need not be powered on to work. Lakicevic's claims regarding this product were published in an issue of the International Journal of Science and Research (ITNJ), a pay-to-publish science journal with no peer review processes in place.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe device was recommended in a report published by Glastonbury Town Council. Town councillor Toby R. Hall stated that the device could be \"helpful\" and \"provide protection\"  due to a \"wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser\".\nAn analysis by Pen Test Partners, however, concluded that this device was nothing more than a 128 megabyte capacity generic USB thumb drive. The security firm concluded that the device \"should [not] be promoted by publicly-funded bodies\".\nFollowing this report, the device was investigated by Trading Standards and found to be a scam and the matter had been referred to City of London Police Fraud Squad.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror (German: Braunbuch über Reichstagsbrand und Hitlerterror) is a book published in Paris, France in August 1933. It was written by an anti-fascist group which included German communist Willi Munzenberg, as well as Hans Siemsen and Gustav Regler. It put forth the theory that Nazis were behind the Reichstag fire of February 27, 1933. According to Spanish novelist Antonio Muñoz Molina it was one of the best selling books of all time.\nThe book details the beginning of Hitler's regime; documenting SA violence against union members and leftists, and it also mentions the Sonnenburg concentration camp which was, at the time, used to imprison political opponents for their “own” protection under the so-called protective custody scheme. \nThe book claimed that Ernst Röhm's assistant Georg Bell, who was murdered in early 1933 in Austria, had been his pimp and had procured Reichstag arsonist Marinus van der Lubbe for Röhm. The book claimed that a clique of homosexual stormtroopers led by Heines set the Reichstag fire; van der Lubbe remained behind and agreed to accept the sole blame because of his desperation for affection; Bell was killed to cover it up. There was no evidence for these claims, and in fact Heines was several hundred kilometers away at the time. Nevertheless, the matter was so politically explosive that it was aired at van der Lubbe's trial in Leipzig. Wackerfuss states that Reichstag conspiracy appealed to antifascists because of their preexisting belief that \"the heart of the Nazis' militant nationalist politics lay in the sinister schemes of decadent homosexual criminals\".\nThe book's cover was designed by John Heartfield. The book was published in English in Great Britain in September 1933 with a foreword by Dudley Aman, 1st Baron Marley.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGöllnitz, Martin (2021). \"Homophobie und Revolutionsangst.

        "title": "George Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire",
        "wikipedia_content": "Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire is a non-fiction book by Michael T. Kaufman released by Random House in 2002, that illuminates the early life, education, work, and controversial philanthropy of George Soros, a man considered by many to be one of the most enigmatic yet globally influential financiers of his era.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nA poor immigrant who made an immense fortune and became one of the largest contributing philanthropists of the twentieth century, George Soros has led a unique place in modern history. As the first biography of Soros, and written with greater depth due to his cooperation, Kaufman's work begins with Soros's childhood as a Jew in his birthplace of Budapest, Hungary, during the German and subsequent Soviet occupations in World War II. It follows him through his education at the London School of Economics, to his unprecedented success on Wall Street after his move to America, and details his reasons for establishing his philanthropic Open Society foundations.\nThe novel provides exclusive insights into the life of a man formerly mysterious and misunderstood, whose struggle to escape the Nazis and survive their occupation strongly contributed to his primary philanthropic goal, namely to use existing organizations and internal grass roots activism to take actions he believed would reduce restrictions on freedom of speech and promote education, economic growth, scientific progress, and civil liberties in nations throughout the world. Toward that end, his Open Society Foundation, which he began in later life and whose name he based on Karl Popper's 1945 opus, The Open Society and its Enemies, has contributed around $32 billion, the vast majority of his wealth, to countries throughout the world to promote civil liberties and economic growth.\nAs of May 2020, Soros had a net worth of $8.3 billion, having donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations, of which $15 billion have already been distributed, representing 64% of his original fortune, thus making him the \"most generous giver\" in terms of percentage of net worth among billionaires according to Forbes. In more recent years he has contributed to approximately 200 political action groups, most of them operating in the United States. His detractors, particularly in the countries where his organizations have been active, often question his motives, achievements, and methods, and often tie their criticisms to their belief that he strongly influences protests and political opponents through political contributions, both public and undeclared.\nOutspoken to a fault, and sometimes appearing contradictory, Soros has arguably become one of the most globally influential men of the last thirty years. In his well researched book, Michael T. Kaufman casts a broad light on a formerly mysterious life, and reveals Soros's motivations and what he views as Soros's considerable contributions to the countries where his foundations are active.\nThe book describes Soros's difficult times as an outsider in London after fleeing Budapest. Though he received an exceptional education at the London School of Economics (LSE), as a non-resident he was required to partially finance his education through odd jobs, including working as a railway porter and a night-club waiter. While at the LSE, he received a Bachelors of Arts, and a Masters, and later received a Doctorate from the University of London. At LSE, he was briefly mentored by Karl Popper who made a lifelong impression. The book details Soros's work as a London salesman, and as a stock trader, followed by his move to work for F. M. Myer on Wall Street.  Between 1969 and 1997 he operated his own hedge fund, initially named Double Eagle, and later the Soros fund. Eventually named the Quantum Fund, it has had the largest growth, and became the most profitable, of its kind in the late twentieth century. His Theory of Reflexivity, borrowed from Popper, states in simplest terms that a person cannot fully know reality, as his own actions constantly alter it in continuous feedback loops. The same concept is applied to his investment theory, and he advises investors to strongly consider how other investors and outside influences affect the market and cause market trends which must be carefully analyzed, and occasionally tend toward a full boom or a full bust.\n\n\n=== Nobel prize nominee ===\nKaufman notes in his section \"Giving It Away\", that despite his numerous detractors, Soros has more than once been recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize. One of the beneficiaries of his foundations, Amnesty International, received the award in 1977. He had been formally nominated for the award in several of the years of the late 1990s, and numerous influential Russian leaders have recommended him for it, most notably Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n\n=== Work in Russia ===\nChapter 19 of Soros's book notes that Soros is still strongly criticized by Vladimir Putin in contemporary Russia. In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order\", specifically the European Union. He hypothesized in 2015 that Putin wanted to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support.\" Despite Putin's more contemporary criticism of Soros, as a result of Soros's efforts during Glasnost and Peristroika in the 1980s and 1990s, Mikhail Gorbachev recommended him for the Nobel Peace Prize for giving grants of $100 million to Soviet scientists when the state had no money to pay them, giving $100 million to free the teachings of Humanities in Universities from their adherence to Marxism–Leninism, contributing funds to promote healthcare and fight disease, and, most notably, spending $100 million for all thirty-three regional Universities in Russia to connect to the Internet. Soros also gave additional millions to elementary and secondary schools for textbooks and libraries.\n\n\n=== Central European University ===\nIn September 1991, funded entirely by him and staffed with globally recognized academics, Soros founded the Central European University, with its first campus in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and with two other campuses in Budapest, Hungary and Warsaw, Poland. In 2018, the central campus moved from Budapest to Vienna, Austria, forced to leave by ruling Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a result of a judicial decision that caused public protest in Hungary and that was opposed by a subsequent ruling of the European Court of Justice. By 2019, it had graduated 16,000 students. Soros's annual gift for the operation of the University reached 20 million dollars, and his personal total endowment is approximated at $880 million.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy and detractors ===\nAdditional narratives on his personal life and Soros's efforts to further human rights in Hungary, China, and Russia complete the final section of Kaufman's biography. Soros's foundations were highly active in opposing Apartheid in South Africa, and in countering what Soros viewed as the restraints on economic growth or reduction in civil liberties posed by Soviet influence in many Eastern European countries, including first his native Hungary, then Poland, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and the Balkans. Prior to 2009, for his work in his native Hungary towards his efforts to modernize the country, Soros was presented with the Medium Cross of Hungary's Republican Order with Stars, the country's second-highest decoration.\nBy the early 90's Soros's foundations were active in eighteen countries, including Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and the new states of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkestan. When Yugoslavia broke apart, new foundations came into being in Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia. In smaller efforts, Soros supported pro-democracy movements in Burma and school construction projects in Albania.\nToday Soros's Open Society Foundations supports freedom and democracy initiatives in over 100 countries around the world. The efforts of Soros's foundations have often faced major political opposition and harsh criticism in many of these countries.\n\n\n==== Controversial views on Israel ====\nIn respect to his views on Israel, in an article in The New Yorker, Soros stated: \"I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence – but I don't want anything to do with it.\" As observed by Kaufman, Soros's views on Israel may reflect his concern for the political and human rights of Palestinians and his frequent support of the rights of refugees, many Palestinians having become refugees on leaving their homes after Israeli independence in 1948. According to hacked emails found in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has had a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy, though it is not clear if Soros currently supports such a policy or what direct connection Soros had to any of the hacked emails. Soros has funded non-government organizations which have been actively critical of Israeli policies, including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. It is not clear if divestment of Israeli products and financial holdings is a policy Soros himself strongly favors, or if the policy should be more strongly attributed to some of the managers in his Open Society Foundations that gave such organizations relatively limited financial support.  \nAn Open Society Policy statement disclosed in 2013 stated \"Our theory of change was based on strengthening the advocacy efforts of civil society organizations and platforms in order to maintain sustained and targeted international advocacy that would oblige the international community (mostly Europe and America) to act and to hold Israel accountable to its obligations under the international law.\" The violations of international law which the Open Society attempted to investigate included actions of the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. A 2009 paper hacked from the Open Society Foundation noted that the organization should strive to \"maintain a low public profile regarding OSI sponsorship of this initiative.\" The Open Society Foundation was \"pushing for Israelis to be 'held accountable' for the 2008–9 Gaza War, when Israel barraged Hamas positions interspersed in the civilian population.\" Soros was wary of revealing his intention to investigate Israel and its Defense Forces concerning Gaza, as he feared backlash from the pro-Israel lobby. Of particular concern was the Open Society's work with Breaking the Silence, an organization of former Israeli soldiers who tour Europe and the U.S. and discuss what they view as the Israel Defense Force's war crimes. A leaked document attributes the Open Society with a sizable endowment of $100,000 to this group between 2012 and 2014. Revealing the testimony of Israeli soldiers is not inherently anti-Israel, and could as easily be viewed as a bold attempt at advocating human rights.  \nThe article, \"George Soros' Israel-Hatred Spills Out Into the Open\" claimed to reveal, through hacked emails, that the Open Society Foundation had given funds to a number of organizations that question certain aspects of Israeli policy, and that in fact Soros hates Israel or is anti-Israel. The article was particularly critical of the Open Society Foundation for not publicly announcing their support for these organizations. The anti-Israel organizations cited by the article include Adalah, the Al-Tufula Center, the Arab Association for Human Rights, Baladna, The Galilee Society, Molad, and the New Israel Fund. At least two of these organizations, including Molad and The New Israel Fund, which is backed by the United States, would be difficult to define as anti-Israel, and are primarily think tanks for progressive ideas and the furthering of human rights in the region. The Galilee Society, which is headquartered in Israel and operates there freely, admits to being \"critical of the Israeli government\", but while being in favor of social and human rights for Arab citizens, and considers itself a balanced organization that sees the need for \"maintaining balance and context beyond simplistic point-scoring in the Israeli–Arab conflict\". The Arab Association for Human Rights, though a group less well integrated into Israeli society as it is headquartered in Cairo, may be considered to be significantly more critical of Israeli policy, but claims to adhere to international law and to have representative counsel at the United Nations.  \nThe organization Adalah, to which Open Society Foundations gave a relatively small endowment, operates freely in Haifa, Israel, and though it considers Palestine an occupied area, it considers itself non-partisan, submits to international humanitarian law, and, with Israeli backing, has brought over twenty cases before the Israeli Supreme court dealing with equality for Arab citizens, including those that furthered health and education in the unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in Israel. It would be odd to claim that an organization which has worked successfully with the Israeli Supreme Court is essentially anti-Israel.   \nThe article quoted a total endowment of $9.5 million to these groups over a fourteen year period between 2001 and 2015. Most of these organizations are recognized as abiding by International Law, and in most cases have offices in Israel. Nonetheless, Soros's past statements on Israel have been far from diplomatic at times, and a cause for concern for many supporters of Israel, particularly a statement he once made blaming a rise in anti-Semitism on the actions of Israel's Defense Forces in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n\n=== Black Wednesday ===\nAs noted by Kaufman, in England, where Soros's hedge funds profited up to a billion dollars from speculating on the value of the pound sterling, Soros was for a period heavily criticized for damaging the British economy as a result of his speculation on the likely devaluation of that currency on September 16, 1992, the date now known as \"Black Wednesday\".  British economists were concerned that the 15–20% devaluation of the pound would reduce the wealth and economic security of their nation's citizens. \n\n\n==== Converting Pounds to German Marks ====\nIn simple terms, Soros, on behalf of his hedge fund, and backed by a multitude of co-investors in his firm, acquired and sold around ten billion British pounds, converting the majority into German marks, which would hold steady against the pound.  A considerable number of investors around the world privately began selling off the pound as well. A majority of the $10 billion pounds which he primarily sold for marks had been borrowed against the assets he held in his Quantum Fund. When the pound was devalued around 10–15 % against the German mark on September 16, Soros realized a considerable profit of around $1 billion.\nBalancing the criticism by many British financial analysts that this move damaged the UK economy, Kaufman noted that Soros had previously invested heavily in British securities during this period, and that during the earlier nationalization of industries imposed by Margaret Thatcher around 1984, Soros's funds were heavily invested in British securities, including in Jaguar automobiles and around $20 million in British Telecom. According to one reliable source, Soros invested $500 million in British stocks shortly before \"Black Wednesday\", in the first few weeks of September 1992, based on the assumption that a country's equities would rise following the devaluation of its currency. The Queen herself, noted Kaufman, had invested in the Quantum Fund, and negative feelings towards Soros would soon be moderated by a growing population segment that admired Soros's foresight and intellect, and admitted their country's use of a currency backed by the precious metal silver was becoming an outmoded form of exchange. Investopedia, an online economic site, has written, \"that economic policies enacted in the U.K. in the aftermath of that day [Black Wednesday] contributed to an improvement in economic growth, lower unemployment, and less inflation.\"\nShortly prior to the currency speculation of Black Wednesday, the British pound was required to trade at a level of about 2.95 German marks in a \"fixed rate\" system. Soros believed that \"Fixed exchange rate systems were flawed, because they eventually fall apart. In fact, any fixed exchange rate system is flawed, and the longer it exists, the greater the flaws become. The only escape is to have no exchange rate system at all, but a single currency in Europe, as in the U.S.\" As noted by Kaufman, unlike most other speculators or men of wealth, Soros used his considerable profit to further invest in economic development and education in other countries, and most heavily in Russia, where he felt economic growth and democratic freedoms were most at risk.\nAs Soros has admitted, at times a small portion of his contributions may have been pocketed by their recipients or used privately by those who should have been administering his foundations, and others have found his positive changes are cut short when a new presidential administration or opposing political movement gains power. In China in 1989, though he made a valiant effort to support economic growth and back anti-Communist dissidents, the Open Society Foundation was forced to close due to the rigidity of China's Communist bureaucracy and opposition from leaders such as Chairman Deng Xiaoping, who associated the group with a competing political faction. In China in 1987, as in several other Communist nations, Soros's Open Society Foundation was erroneously suspected of being tied to efforts of America's Central Intelligence Agency to undermine Communism or export China's technological secrets.\n\n\n=== Project on Death in America ===\nAfter the death of his father in 1968, Soros felt strongly that the elderly should, if at all possible, be given the opportunity to die at home on their own terms, as the majority wished to die, according to polls.  He promoted, but did not seek to legislate, that those dying in great pain from terminal illnesses be given the opportunity to discuss ending their lives with their children and legal counsel.  Soros was strongly criticized by many conservatives for allowing a segment of the elderly population to discuss their option to end their lives when there was no way of ending their pain and little chance of obtaining medical assistance that might extend their lives. Many believed this \"right\" could be exploited by other family members seeking their inheritance, or that death might be administered too early.  In 1993, Soros held a meeting of experts to discuss what would become known as the Project on Death in America.\n\n\n=== Strongest opponents ===\n\nThe book covers Soros's global opponents and describes some of Soros's American critics, though Kaufman is fundamentally a supporter of Soros in general, perhaps most strongly because of the depth and scale of Soros's philanthropic efforts. Kaufman writes that many of Soros's strongest European and Asian opponents were at one point identified as autocrats, and usually were dictatorial leaders who stifled the opposition press, and feared the influence of outsiders who might open the way to reform. The books say that Soros has \"in fact crossed rhetorical swords with a sizable portion of the world's autocrats, dictators, and despots\". It argues that Soros's outspoken and often undiplomatic criticism of ruling elites, particularly in Post-Communist countries, may have been his single greatest weakness in obtaining his political objectives.\n\n\n==== Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia ====\n\nKaufman observed that Soros has openly feuded with and been denounced by the former Serbian and Yugoslavian President, Slobodan Milosevic  who attempted to have Soros's foundation evicted for their support of independent media. Milosevic was charged with war crimes in 1999 by an international tribunal and had stifled the opposition press during periods of his administration.\n\n\n==== Franjo Tudjman, Croatia ====\n\nIn Croatia, where Soros's foundations also provided economic support, Franjo Tudjman, a nationalistic leader, attempted to punish Soros's Zagreb-based foundation by bringing suits against those providing grants. The Open Foundation's conflict likely occurred during the period of Tudjman's tenure as president when he was criticized as authoritarian by some observers. At least one political observer viewed  Tudjman's post-war policies negatively, remarking that \"between healthy nationalism and chauvinism, he chose chauvinism; between free-market economy and clientelism, he chose the latter. Instead of the cult of freedom, he chose the cult of the state.\n\n\n==== Aleksandr Lukashenko, Belarus ====\nIn Belarus, Communist leader Aleksandr Lukashenko forced the closure of Soros's Minsk foundation by promising to bring criminal investigations into its staff. In 2001, the BBC referred to Belarus under Lukashenko as \"Europe's last dictatorship\", and criticized Lukashenko for not hosting free elections or maintaining robust freedom of the press.\n\n\n==== Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia ====\n\nIn Slovakia, Vladimir Meciar, accused of authoritarian styles of leadership in the 1990s, used the press to defame Soros with anti-Semitic slurs similar to those that had formerly been used in Hungary. In April 2000, Meciar was arrested and charged with abuse of power and fraud during his term as Slovokian Prime Minister in the 1990s.\n\n\n==== Boris Berezovsky, Russia ====\nIn Russia, Soros may have erred in criticizing wealthy oligarch Boris Berezovsky, whom he truly considered dangerous to Russia as a result of his political stands and possible financial corruption.  Always outspoken, his criticism also extended to members of Boris Yeltsin's family.  Soros was in turn targeted by media attacks likely initiated by Berezovsky and Yeltsin, though Soros was admired and his causes usually endorsed by Mikail Gorbachev.  In total, at least prior to Putin's administration in Russia, Soros's foundations have faced less criticism than in many other nations, and the actions taken by Yeltsin, and his successors have been relatively moderate.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nIn the United States, Kaufman noted that Soros has come under attack frequently by leaders of the country's \"war on drugs\", who abhor his attempts to deal with narcotics as a public health rather than a criminal problem. They attacked him for supporting referendums in five states to legalize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. More recent opposition has been by critics who believe his foundations have provided funding to support the campaigns of judges and attorneys general they consider soft on crime.\nIn August 2009, after the book's publication, Soros donated $35 million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified.  An additional $140 million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.  Soros's turn to more clearly charitable contributions, though earlier work opening universities, providing scholarships, and fighting disease, could also be seen as primarily charitable, may have been a result of controversies caused by his donations to American political candidates who were Democrats, particularly presidential candidates.\n\n\n==== Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia ====\n\nBut Soros may have been most vehemently attacked by long serving Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. When the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, dropped in value by 20% in 1997, Mahathir blamed Soros and currency speculators, evoking anti-Semitic themes by mentioning Soros with two Jewish felons accused of financial improprieties Ivan Boesky, and Michael Milken.  Kaufman notes, that at the time Mahthir was accusing Soros of driving down the currency, Soros's Quantum fund and other speculators were actually buying Malaysian ringgits in the mistaken belief their value had bottomed out.\n\n\n=== Nazi collaborator theory debunked ===\nSignificantly, Kaufman strongly disputes the frequently cited claim that Soros collaborated with the Nazis during his youth in Budapest. His book may be the most frequently quoted source by newspaper and online articles seeking to counter this theory. As Kaufman chronicled, as an adolescent in the early 1940s Soros once briefly worked as a courier for the Jewish Council, or Judenrat, an organization set up by the Nazis that exclusively used young Jewish boys to distribute messages. One day George was required to distribute what appeared to be summonses to the homes of several lawyers that instructed them to report to the \"rabbinical seminary on Rok Szilard Street\" and to bring food for two days. The ultimate destination of those who received the messages was unknown to the recipients, and certainly unknown to the thirteen year old Soros. George's father Tivadar Soros allowed him to deliver the messages only once, but instructed him to warn the recipients that if they followed the instruction \"they may be deported\". According to Kaufman's account, which used Soros's parents as his primary source, George's father then convinced his son that he should quit working at the council and advised Soros that some rules should not be followed, even if it risked the horrific retribution of their Nazi occupiers.\n\n\n=== 60 Minutes interview refuted ===\nIn another incident in Soros' youth in Hungary that was later used to impugn Soros's character, and was touched on in a December 1998 interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" with Steve Kroft, Kaufman chronicled how George's father Tividar arranged to have George stay with a man named Baumbach while George posed as a Christian named Sandor Kiss to hide his Jewish identify from the Nazis.  As an employee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Baumbach was one day tasked with assessing the \"artworks, furnishings and other property\", of Mor Kornfield, a wealthy aristocrat of Jewish origin and decided to take George with him rather than leave him alone for several days. Kornfield had formerly been able to leave Germany and flee to Lisbon. Kroft, in his \"60 minutes\" interview, inaccurately stated that Soros's father had \"bribed a government official\" to swear George was his Godson, and then dramatically and somewhat deceptively added the narrative line that \"as hundreds of thousands of Jews were being shipped off to the Nazi death camps, a thirteen year old George Soros accompanied his phony Godfather on his rounds, confiscating property from the Jews\". Baumbach, working in an economy with few choices, only inventoried the property, and according to Kaufman through the writings of Tivadar Soros, George's father, fourteen year old George had no awareness that the Nazis might later confiscate it.\nGeorge's father Tivadar, upon hearing the story, removed George from Baumbach's care and attempted to hide his son elsewhere. In contrast to the image of Soros's family provided by the 60 Minutes interview, according to Kaufman, George's father Tivadar labored part-time selling false identity and visa papers to Jews that might allow them to flee Germany.  The Washington Post also wrote that the Soros family provided identity papers to Jews in Budapest. Tivadar Soros, as did Erzebet, recorded their recollections of George's life well before the 60 minutes interview, and Tivadar died in February 1968, long before the CBS interview. The Washington Post has written that Kroft's interview led to the \"ugliest conspiracy theory about Soros\", as it was reprised later in harsher form by Glenn Beck for a Fox Cable News station and was later expanded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to include the number of Jews supposedly killed by Soros. Emily Tamlin, the author of the Post article, also significantly noted that in the 60 Minutes interview, Soros clearly stated  that \"he did not participate in the confiscation and was merely brought along.\"\n\n\n== Work with Council on Foreign Relations ==\nBill Maynes, a head of the Eurasia fund, nominated Soros for membership to America's Council on Foreign Relations, one of the most respected and guarded organizations of the American foreign policy establishment.  Though initially many members had doubts about Soros's knowledge of international relations and questioned his knowledge due to his wealth, Maynes, later noted that \"eventually he (Soros) was accepted by the council but it took quite a long time\".  As noted by Kaufman, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has said of Soros, though he considers him overly ambitious in his goals and believes he underestimates the complexity of global problems he strives to address, \"I have great respect for George Soros and I think on the whole he has done good things, even in areas where he oversimplifies.  His input is important and I respect and admire him\".\n\n\n== Critical reviews ==\nAnthony Gottlieb, writing in the New York Times Book Review gave a positive review that some may find too rich in its praise, noting that while writing about such an unusually strong, unique, and deep personality as Soros, that Kaufman did far more than write a shallow homage to a one dimensional heroic figure. He concludes that \"Thanks to this we have an extraordinarily vivid and colorful portrait of one of the most interesting and farsighted figures of our time-a man who through his achievements showed that one can build and use a fortune to help others live better and more wisely.\"\nAndrew Leonard in Salon described Kaufman's insight into Soros's psychological make up the single greatest contribution of the book, and found the novel spell binding, particularly the opening chapters.  He writes, \"Soros is never fawning, and the psychological portrait it draws is convincing and illuminating. Soros' life, no matter how you slice it, has been extraordinary. The first several chapters read like a thriller. Kaufman excels at dissecting and explaining Soros' psychological makeup.\"\nFinally John Rothchild of the New York Times, considers Kaufman's work, \"A flinty-eyed exposition of a brilliant capitalist, devoted provocateur and accidental humanitarian. You come away believing it is possible to be a really rich man and a really good man after all.\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nVox: George Soros is Not a Nazi Explained\nForbes: The Troubling Truth About the Obsession with George Soros: Anti-Semitism\nWashington Post:Five Myths About George Soros\nWashington Post: Representative Louie Gohmert falsely says George Soros Helped Take Property From Fellow Jews\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSlater, Robert, Soros: The World's Most Influential Investor, (1996), McGraw Hill, New York\nSoros, George, The Alchemy of Finance, (1987), John Wiley and Sons, New York\nSoros, George, Opening the Soviet System, (1990), Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London\nSoros, George, Soros on Soros, (1990), John Wiley and Sons, New York\nSoros, George, Underwriting Democracy, (1991), The Free Press, New York\nSoros, George, The Crisis of Global Capitalism, (1998), Public Affairs, New York\nSoros, George, Open Society: Reforming Global Capitalism, (2000), Public Affairs, New York\nSoros, George, The Burden of Consciousness (Unpublished Manuscript)\n\n\n== Notes from book and references ==",

        "title": "Baron 52",
        "wikipedia_content": "Baron 52 was the call sign of a United States Air Force EC-47 carrying eight crew members that was shot down over Laos during the predawn hours of 5 February 1973, a week after the Paris Peace Accords officially ended the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The remains of four crewmen were recovered from the crash site, but those of the remaining four have never been found. Although the U.S. government considers them to have been killed in action and as late as 1996 listed them as \"accounted for\", family members and POW/MIA advocates believe the four survived the crash and were taken captive and possibly sent to the USSR. The intelligence gatherers and their equipment would have been highly valued by the Soviets who maintained a presence both in Laos and North Vietnam. The incident has been featured on several nationwide news programs and a 1991 episode of the U.S. television series Unsolved Mysteries.\n\n\n== The mission ==\nAlthough the Paris Peace Accords had officially ended the United States' direct role in the Vietnam War, only a week after its signing the U.S. Air Force sent an EC-47Q electronic warfare collection aircraft on a night-time radio-direction-finding mission to monitor the Ho Chi Minh trail and locate North Vietnamese tanks moving south. The plane, tail number 43-48636, belonged to the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron and began its mission from Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. The flight crew also were part of the 361st while the collection crew manning the rear of the plane were from Detachment 3, 6994th Security Squadron. Over Laos, the plane began taking anti-aircraft fire and went down in Salavan Province, Laos about 50 miles (80 km) east of the city of Salavan and 20 miles (32 km) from the border with South Vietnam at a site in the jungle within 8 miles (13 km) of three major roads leading into North Vietnamese-held territory.\n\n\n== Crew ==\n361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron:\n\nCapt. George R. Spitz – Pilot\n2nd Lt. Severo J. Primm III – Co-Pilot\nCapt. Arthur R. Bollinger – Navigator\n1st Lt. Robert E. Bernhardt – 3rd Pilot\n6994th Security Squadron:\n\nSSgt. Todd M. Melton – Radio Operator\nSgt. Joseph A. Matejov – Radio Operator\nSgt. Peter R. Cressman – Radio Operator\nSgt. Dale Brandenburg – Systems Repair Technician\n\n\n== Recovery efforts ==\nThe location of the wreckage was first discovered by U.S. Air Force search and rescue on 7 February 1973. The plane was determined to have crashed inverted, coming to rest upside down in the jungle; both wings had been sheared off. A team consisting of three pararescuemen and an intelligence expert were on the ground for approximately an hour and found three bodies in the charred wreckage, those of Spitz, Primm and Bollinger in the cockpit, still strapped in their seats. Outside of the wreckage, they found Lt. Bernhardt's body. In the rear of the plane they observed that the jump door had been removed (it was never located), the crew's safety belts were unbuckled, and all of the top secret sensitive equipment was missing as were the rear crew's parachutes.\nOn 9 February 1973, Bernhardt's remains were recovered and positively identified four days later. On 22 February, the other four men were declared killed in action despite no confirmation of their fates.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe families of the missing crew members believe there is evidence they bailed out and were taken captive by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). They point to information in official reports, such as the fact that their safety belts were unbuckled and their remains were not at the crash site, to support their beliefs that the rear crew had time to bail out. In addition, at approximately 8:00 AM on 5 February, U.S. Intelligence listening post at Phu Bai Combat Base in South Vietnam intercepted PAVN communications from the area indicating they were transporting four captured Airmen. Such communications continued to be intercepted for the next three months. Also on record is a Pathet Lao radio intercept regarding four \"air pirates\" captured the day Baron 52 was shot down; no other U.S. aircraft was downed that day. A Laotian operative secretly working for the U.S. reported observing the transport of four prisoners along the road near the crash site. All of these records remained classified by the U.S. government. This evidence was first presented to the American public by columnist Jack Anderson on the U.S. news program Good Morning America in 1978. During Anderson's report, he stated a \"Pentagon spokesman now agrees there's a good chance these four men were survivors of the crash. Yet, the Pentagon deliberately gave the families misinformation\".\nIn 1992, in front of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified that it was the government's position that these reports were unrelated to Baron 52; this testimony was repeated in 1994 before the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In November 1992, the Lao government allowed a team to survey the crash site where a dogtag with Sgt. Matejov's name on it was found, after nearly 20 years, lying in plain sight. Also recovered were 23 bone fragments and half of a tooth which were taken to the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, where Ellis R. Kerley publicly stated that the bone fragments \"can not be proven conclusively to be human.\" According to further testimony given before the House Subcommittee by Albert Santoli, Kerley was replaced by \"a U.S. Army Lt. Colonel, professionally a dentist, who has limited forensic experience\", and the bone fragments were declared to be the remains of all four of the remaining crew members. The families requested DNA analysis be done on the bone fragments and tooth, but their requests were denied by the government.\nOn 27 March 1996, the bone fragments were interred at Arlington National Cemetery in a group burial. The families of all eight men attended although the families of the four rear crew members were there to \"honor the sacrifice\" of the flight crew and did not believe the bone fragments were those of Melton, Matejov, Cressman or Brandenburg.  Matejov's younger brother, John Matejov, has sought help from both Wyoming Senators and Congressmen in petitioning the Pentagon for further information as well as appealing directly to President Obama. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Roger Shields said the government \"acted 'precipitously' to declare Matejov and the other three missing crew members to be dead\". In their book, The Men We Left Behind, Mark Sauter and Jim Sanders wrote that \"The names were scratched from the list (of MIAs) because they were an inconvenience that would have complicated Henry Kissinger's life\". Kissinger negotiated the Paris Peace Accords and was responsible for carrying out President Nixon's promise to bring all POWs home. They further alleged that \"the men weren't dead, and the Pentagon knew it\" and that it was covered up because the flight was illegal under the Paris agreement.\nCongress reviewed the status of the four crewmen in 2016. The status of one of the four crewman was not changed to MIA in 2016. As of September 2020 the entire crew is listed by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency as accounted for.\n\n\n== References ==\nBaron 52 [1] Baron 52 MIAfacts {reference only}",

        "title": "Furtive fallacy",
        "wikipedia_content": "The furtive fallacy is an informal fallacy of emphasis in which historical outcomes are asserted to be the result of hidden (furtive) misconduct or wrongdoing by decision makers. Historian David Hackett Fischer identified it as the belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister, and that \"history itself is a story of causes mostly insidious and results mostly invidious.\" Although it may lead to a conspiracy theory, the fallacy itself consists in the assumption that misdeeds lurk behind every page of history. In its extreme form, the fallacy represents general paranoia.\nFischer identified several examples of the fallacy, with particular attention to the works of Charles A. Beard and his critic Forrest McDonald. Beard had argued that Franklin Roosevelt secretly and intentionally maneuvered the country into World War II. Although some critics accused him of falsifying the historical record, Fischer believed that Beard was merely pursuing a long-held misconception about how history occurs. McDonald, meanwhile, offered sensational descriptions of the early United States in which history unfolded through episodes of corruption and drunkenness.\nRichard Hofstadter discussed the fallacy before Fischer, although not by name. In reviewing histories from the Progressive Era, Hofstadter noted that the progressive historians tended to assume that reality was always hidden and ignored, being determined by bribes, rebates, and secret business deals.\nA modification of the furtive fallacy holds that when the historical record provides no evidence explaining a particular set of events, this is itself evidence of a furtive cause.\nThe idea of the furtive fallacy was criticized by Jeffrey M. Bale, author of the book The Darkest Sides of Politics, who cited the risk of historians underestimating the influence of political secret societies, vanguard parties, and intelligence agencies.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDuthie, James A.

        "title": "FV Gaul",
        "wikipedia_content": "The fishing vessel Gaul was a deep sea factory ship based at Hull, United Kingdom. She was launched in December 1971 by Brooke Marine of Lowestoft, entering service during 1972 with the Ranger Fishing company, where she was registered at North Shields as Ranger Castor, SN18. She was renamed when Ranger Fishing was bought by British United Trawlers and re-registered at Hull as Gaul, H243. She sank some time on the night of 8–9 February 1974 in storm conditions in the Barents Sea, north of Norway. No distress signal was received and her loss was not realised until 10 February after she twice failed to report in. An extensive search operation was launched but no trace of the ship was found, apart from a lifebuoy recovered three months later. All thirty-six crew were lost. The president of the British Trawler Federation described the loss of the Gaul as \"the worst ever single-trawler tragedy\".  The wreck was finally located in 1997.\n\n\n== Final voyage ==\nGaul sailed from Hull on the morning of 22 January 1974. Mate George Petty became ill and was put ashore at Lødingen on the 26th. Maurice Spurgeon joined the crew on the 28th at Tromsø and Gaul arrived at the fishing grounds off the north coast of Norway the following day. On 8 February the sea state became severe. Reports from the skippers of other trawlers in the area give the wave height at between 6.5 and 9m, wind between 7 and 10 on the Beaufort scale.\nAt 09:30 Gaul reported to British United Trawlers that she was \"laid and dodging off the North Cape Bank\".  At 10:30, as was company policy,  she reported  to the Orsino on the \"Skipper's Freezer Schedule\" – a summary of position, weather conditions, catch etcetera. A further report was due at 16:30 but Gaul, alone of the 17 British United Trawlers ships in the area at the time, failed to report.\n\nBy the afternoon of 10 February British United Trawlers had alerted their insurance company, UK Trawlers Mutual that Gaul had failed to report for two days. On the following morning the insurance company sent out a message to all the trawlers they insured reading To all vessels fishing North Bank, Norway – all vessels please report any contact with the GAUL last reported fishing North Bank. Nil reports not required.\nThe aircraft carrier HMS Hermes was in the area and was ordered to commence searching. The search involved four other British ships, three Norwegian ships and 19 trawlers, coordinated by the Hermes. No evidence of the missing Gaul was found and the search was called off on the afternoon of 15 February.\n\n\n== The 1970s Formal Investigation ==\nThe original Formal Investigation in 1974 concluded that the most likely reason for her loss was that she was overwhelmed by a succession of very large waves in heavy seas and capsized. The preliminary investigation had also found deficiencies in the maintenance of chutes, doors and hatches on Gaul's sister ship Kurd, but the relevance of this fact was downplayed at the formal inquiry.\nGaul was one of the most modern ships in the UK fishing fleet — she was only 18 months old — and relatives of the crew were reluctant to accept the investigation findings.\nIn 1975 a TV programme claimed she had been sunk while engaging in espionage and over the years other theories, including conspiracy theories, have been advanced:\n\nShe was captured and interned by the Soviet Union because she was engaged in espionage.\nShe was sunk by a Soviet submarine for the same reason.\nShe collided with a submarine engaged in clandestine operations.\nShe was dragged under after snagging her trawling gear in secret undersea cables (SOSUS).\n\n\n== The wreck is found ==\nIn 1975 the Norwegian trawler Rairo reported snagging her nets on an undersea obstruction in the area where the Gaul was lost. In 1977, however, the UK government decided against launching a search based on this (and other similar) information, despite being confident that this was indeed Gaul. It was argued that such an investigation would add little new information in aid of safety at sea to justify the cost.\nIn 1997 a TV crew, with help from Norwegian experts located the wreck exactly where Rairo had reported the snagging of her nets. She was discovered to be located some 70 nautical miles (130 km; 81 mi) off the northern coast of Norway and lying in 919 feet (280 m) of water.\nThis prompted UK Deputy Prime Minister (and Hull MP) John Prescott to ask the Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport to carry out extensive surveys of the wreck, which it did in 1998 and 2002. During the latter part of the underwater survey in 2002, samples of bones and other human remains were recovered from the wreck, DNA tests conducted by the Forensic Science Service established that the remains came from four of the Gaul's crew. This finding quelled suspicions that the crew had been taken from the vessel by the Russians during cold war hostilities. After reviewing the factual evidence gained from the underwater  surveys, the MAIB concluded that there was enough new evidence to warrant a new formal inquiry. The surveys revealed that some of Gaul's hatches and doors were open and, specifically, the outer non-return flaps and the inner covers to the duff and offal waste chutes were open. Additionally, the inner cover to the duff chute appeared to be secured open and the ship's steering gear (a steerable kort nozzle) was found to show between 10° and 15° of port helm. John Prescott concurred with the MAIB and a new investigation was launched (the 2004 Re-opened Formal Investigation (RFI)).\n\n\n== 2004 inquiry ==\nOn 17 December 2004 the RFI concluded that these open chutes, doors and hatches had compromised the ship's watertight integrity and, combined with a following (and as already noted) heavy sea led to flooding on the factory deck. The RFI also postulated that an attempted emergency manoeuvre by the Gaul's officer of the watch (a perfectly logical move to try to turn 'into the sea') caused 100 tonnes of floodwater to surge across to the starboard side of the ship leading to capsize and a catastrophic loss of stability. Further flooding then took place through open doors, chutes and hatches until the Gaul lost her reserves of buoyancy, she then sank very rapidly, stern first.\nThe report of the RFI dismissed the notion that Gaul was involved in espionage  or that she was in a collision. It found that she was not fishing at the time of her loss, which indicated that no snagging (of the nets) could have occurred.  Regarding espionage the report did include, verbatim, the following submission from Commander Clark RN: \"Skippers, radio officers and Mates of trawlers were involved in the low level observation and photography of Soviet vessels and aircraft and passive listening. This was on both a voluntary and an opportunity basis. General records and press cuttings on file indicate that some 30 to 40 Skippers were involved in the 1960s when this activity was at its peak. No records of trawler personnel involved in this activity exist in MOD files....However this type of intelligence gathering declined in the early 1970s. I have seen nothing to indicate that the crew of the FV GAUL were involved in this type of activity.\"  \nThe commissioner for wrecks, Mr Justice Steel, told the inquiry that the 1974/5 inquiry had been inadequate and that it had been an \"open secret\" that the trawler had been involved in spying.\nIn the immediate wake of the report, relatives of the crew said they were not satisfied and claimed that the \"truth was still to be told\".\n\n\n== Memorial service ==\nIn February 2014, a memorial service was held on St. Andrew's Quay, Hull, to mark the 40th anniversary of the loss of the Gaul.\nIn 2024 there will be a multitude of different events held in Hull, from 8 to 15 February, in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of The Gaul.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGaul was one of four ships in her class. the others were Kurd, Kelt and Arab (later Kappin).\nShe was a stern trawler, meaning that the nets were cast off of the back of the ship (rather than the side, as with a sidewinder trawler)\nShe was a filleter-freezer factory ship and processed fish, as well as catching it. This means she effectively had two crews, the 'sailing' crew and the factory crew. The Reopened Formal Investigation noted this as a potential risk factor if the factory crew were not fully conversant with the safe operation of Gaul.\nThe report claimed that the skipper and Mate, although experienced mariners, had never sailed in a ship of Gaul's class, specifically ships with separate factory crew.\nThe chutes at the centre of the RFI's conclusions were the duff and offal chutes, used to dispose of unwanted marine organisms and fish processing waste respectively. The Wreck Commissioner, Mr Justice Steel, said of the poor condition of these chutes: \"This reflects poorly on the maintenance and repair work performed by the owners and their staff.\"\nThe inquiry secured for the first time official confirmation that the UK government used trawlers for espionage during the Cold War, but found no evidence that Gaul was – or had ever been – so used.\nIn 2010 an independent and critical investigation was carried out into the Gaul's reserves of operational stability, the results of which revealed that she did not meet the IMCO (now IMO) minimum stability standards in all of her anticipated seagoing conditions.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"Accident Investigation Report: Gaul\".

        "title": "Sydney Warburg",
        "wikipedia_content": "Sydney Warburg (1880–1947) is the pen name of an author or a group of authors who remained anonymous and who published a book about funding of the Nazi Party by American bankers between 1929 and 1933. The book's Dutch title De geldbronnen van het Nationaal-Socialisme: drie gesprekken met Hitler refers to three conversations Warburg said Sydney would have had with Adolf Hitler. The original states that the text was \"Door Sydney Warburg, vertaald door J.G. Schoup\" (By Sydney Warburg, translated by J.G. Schoup).\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe original version of this book was published in 1933 under the title De geldbronnen van het nationaal-socialisme, 3 gesprekken met Hitler (Financial origins of national socialism) in the Netherlands. According to Jean Gustave Schoup (sometimes spelled as Jan Gustaaf Schoup) the original text had been provided by Sydney Warburg and J.G. Schoup had translated this text English into Dutch. After the book came out the Dutch publisher learned from various sources that no \"Sydney Warburg\" existed in the New York Warburg family and called back all copies from book dealers and destroyed the whole edition. A German version exists with the title: So wurde Hitler finanziert, Das verschollene Dokument von Sidney Warburg über die internationalen Geldgeber des Dritten Reiches, herausgegeben und eingeleitet von Ekkehard Franke-Gricksch, Verlag Diagnosen, Leonberg 1983, ISBN 3-923864-00-0.\nThe original Dutch text was republished in 2008 together with an introduction by Karl Hammer Kaatee. \n\n\n== Book summary ==\nThe so-called \"Sydney Warburg\", presented by the translator of 1933 as the son of a great American banker of Kuhn, Loeb & Co (Felix Warburg), describes a meeting had taken place in July 1929 with a \"Carter\" (John Ridgley Carter, who married Alice Morgan) the president of JP Morgan's Guarantee Trust, the leaders of the Federal Reserve, \"the young Rockefeller\" – John D. Rockefeller Jr. – and \"Glean from Royal Dutch\" (Henri Deterding). It was decided that Warburg who spoke German, had to travel to Germany and ask Hitler how much money he needed to become head of state. The only condition was that Hitler would take an \"aggressive foreign policy\". The intention of the sponsors of Warburg is not to cause a war between France and Germany, but to cause a threat of war on France for engagement as possible to support the financial affairs of the United States and Great Britain.\n\"Sydney Warburg\" details three meetings with Hitler between 1929 and 1933. In total approximately $32 million were transferred to the NSDAP.\n\n\n=== 1929 ===\nThe first meeting took place in a brewery and Hitler calculated his needs on a sheet of paper with the help of a Von Heydt. It appears from the book that Hitler would have received nearly $10 million in 1929. This was a very significant amount in this time of economic depression – the Nazis gave food and shelter to many supporters. Hitler was not informed of the reason for their help and did not ask. On one occasion he would have asked out loud if \"Warburg\" was himself Jewish, but had rejected the idea before he could answer.\n\n\n=== 1931 ===\nIn October 1931, Warburg received a letter informing him that Hitler had spent all the 10 million and needed new financing. Back in Germany, he met Hitler again in his home where he asked \"500 million marks to make a revolution or 200 million marks for acquiring power legally\". Warburg, having telegraphed its bankers received a refusal message. He is visited by Hermann Göring and Julius Streicher and literally gets caught in part by Göring who accuses him of avarice. After having complained to Hitler about the behavior of his lieutenant, he received a letter of apology from Göring and next a visit from Von Heydt and Gregor Strasser. He eventually passes on the final response of its sponsors: $15 million at most. The amount is divided into three transfers: one at Mendelsohn & Co., Amsterdam, where he travels to with Von Heydt, the other in the Rotterdamsche Bankvereniging, Rotterdam, where he goes to with Gregor Strasser, and the third at Banca Italiana in Rome with Göring. In Rome, Italo Balbo and Cesare Rossi receive them, he and Göring.\n\n\n=== 1933 ===\nWarburg is in Berlin on the day of the Reichstag fire. On the evening of that day he meets Göring and Goebbels, and finally he met Hitler. Hitler asks again if he is a Jew but he responds by saying that he has a German name. Warburg promises Hitler $7 million payable directly to Warburg via Rhenania Joint Stock Co., the German branch of Royal Dutch in Düsseldorf. The book concludes with considerations by Warburg about predicting anything good on the consequences of these money transfers: The world continues to suffer under a system that has to bow to a Hitler to keep itself on its feet. Poor world, poor humanity!. The NSDAP and Hitler came to power.\n\n\n=== Epilogue ===\nThe book concludes with an unsigned epilogue that has been written in 1946. This epilogue was not written by Sydney Warburg. In the epilogue it has been mentioned that Joseph Goebbels wrote the following in his diary Von Kaiserhof zur Reichskanzlei on February 20, 1933: \"We are in the process of raising significant funds which will resolve our financial problems at once.\" However, it is unclear whether this jubilant exclamation from Goebbels refers to the Sydney Warburg transaction.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe book that has been published under the pseudonym Sydney Warburg, De Geldbronnen van het nationaal Socialisme: drie gesprekken met Hitler (Funding of National Socialism: Three Conversations with Hitler), published by Van Holkema & Warendorf's Uitg.-Mij. NV disappeared almost immediately from bookstores. This book dealt with funding received by the Nazi Party in 1929, 1931 and 1933.\nFranz von Papen recommends the book in his memoirs that were published in 1953.\nHenry Coston wrote in 1975 that Otto Strasser alone is the author.\nThe editor of the English version of Hitler's Secret Backers wrote in 1983 that the original edition of this book might have been a warning by an individual member of the Warburg family against the coming European war.\nPierre de Villemarest wrote in 1984 that the pseudonym Sydney Warburg could refer to Georg Bell, a German engineer acting as an agent of Henri Deterding, or the brothers Otto Strasser and Gregor Strasser.\nAccording to what E.R. Carmin wrote in 1994 the book is a factual testimony as to Des Griffin.\nIn the introduction of the 2008 edition Karl Hammer Kaatee wrote that J.G. Schoup's son had admitted that J.G. Schoup had published under a pseudonym what he had learned himself as a spy about Hitler's financial backers.\nThe author Ben Peri evokes the theme in a pamphlet published in 2011.\nAccording to what the journalist Louis Kilzer wrote in 2011, James Paul Warburg is the person named in the book as intermediary, that he is the perpetrator or not.\nCees van Hoore described Jean Gustave Schoup in 2014 as follows: \"Schoup was not only a talented writer but also a crook who boasted about his contacts inside the German Sicherheitsdienst. He told the resistance that he could liberate arrested resisters by paying ransom to these German contacts. However, Schoup kept the money for himself. I think this is why Schoup has been liquidated in 1944.\"\nJasper Wielaert proved previously in 2014 that Schoup, aiming to profit, did indeed cunningly deceive the resistance. Nevertheless, he also arranged hiding places for Jewish people. Above that Jasper Wielaert makes it thoroughly clear that corrupt members of the Rotterdam resistance in 1944–1945 were equally involved in seeking financial gain. Wielaert hints that the individuals involved in the assassination may have been interested in murdering him not just because of his scams, but for their own very personal reasons.\n\n\n== Denial ==\nFor Jacques Attali, the Sydney Warburg in question, posing the son of Felix Warburg, Warburg is imaginary, from which no one has carried this name of Sydney It will be worth many family denials and false pamphleteer published in Amsterdam will be awarded to a Dutch journalist scandal. The book was the subject of an indignant denial in 1949, as a signed declaration (an affidavit) by James Warburg, son of one of the two Warburg brothers implicated in the book.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSydney Warburg approximates about another later book whose provenance is uncertain repeating verbatim the thesis summarizing and adding the financing of international communism by international finance : Symphony in red.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Exaro",
        "wikipedia_content": "Exaro or Exaro News was a British website based in London between 2011 and 2016. It purportedly undertook political investigative journalism, but is now primarily known (together with its editor Mark Watts) for its direct involvement in the false allegations of sexual abuse put forward by \"Nick\" (Carl Beech) in Operation Midland.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nLaunched in October 2011, Exaro, under its motto \"Holding Power to Account\", claimed to specialise in \"carrying out in-depth investigations\". Its website claimed it 'set out to produce \"evidence-based, open-access journalism – not spin, not churnalism, not hacking – just journalism about what should be transparent but isn't\"'. Exaro was reportedly set up by City of London fund manager and climate denier Jerome Booth.\nIn articles by journalist Mark Conrad, Exaro became the first publication to report claims made by Carl Beech (under the pseudonym \"Nick\") that a paedophile ring composed of powerful individuals had abused children at Elm Guest House in Barnes in the late 1970s and early 1980s. MP Tom Watson (Labour), having been passed information from Exaro journalists, raised the allegations in parliament. Police subsequently launched a scoping exercise under the name \"Operation Fairbank\"; later, a full-scale criminal investigation specifically addressing allegations relating to Elm Guest House was launched under the name \"Operation Fernbridge\". The latter investigation was subsequently closed after no evidence to support the claims was found.\nFalse allegations of sex crimes and murder committed by the fictional paedophile ring made by Beech later became the basis for the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland, a £2 million probe which closed in 2016 with no charges brought. A later inquiry found that the accused were victims of false allegations. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner issued an apology to Beech's victims. In July 2019, Beech was convicted of charges related to his false claims and was jailed for eighteen years.\nFormer MP Harvey Proctor (Conservative), whose home was raided as part of the failed investigation, charged that Exaro acted as Beech's \"support team\". Exaro's then-editor-in-chief, Mark Watts, stood by the website's coverage and said they \"never asserted\" that Beech's claims were true, but also called Beech's conviction 'wholly unsafe' because he did not think Beech got a fair trial after the judge had allowed jurors to hear that he had pleaded guilty to child pornography offences in a separate trial.\nFormer MP John Hemming (Liberal Democrats), who had been falsely accused of abuse in an article by Exaro journalist David Hencke, succeeded in a libel action against him in January 2019, resulting in Hencke and Graham Wilmer of the Lantern Project paying over £10,000 in compensation for the false allegations. In August 2019, Staffordshire Police confirmed that they were investigating whether Hemming's accuser, Esther Baker, had misled detectives.\n\n\n== Other investigations ==\n\n\n=== Civil service tax avoidance ===\nOn 1 February 2012, an investigation by Exaro revealed that the UK's Student Loans Company was paying its chief executive, Ed Lester, through a private company, enabling him to reduce his tax bill by tens of thousands of pounds. The day after the story broke the Chief Secretary of the Treasury, Danny Alexander, was summoned to the House of Commons for an urgent debate. Alexander announced a review of all civil service contracts.\n\n\n=== Rupert Murdoch ===\nIn partnership with Channel 4 News, Exaro revealed secretly recorded tapes of News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch talking to journalists from the News-owned The Sun newspaper, in which he criticised the \"incompetent cops\" who handled the News of the World phone hacking case and promised to take care of any Sun journalist that had broken the law.\n\n\n=== Military intervention in Syria ===\nIn July 2011, a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) expert told Exaro that the chances of a foreign military incursion into Syria to secure chemical weapons had risen to \"more than 50 per cent\". That same month, Exaro also reported that hawks in the US government were pressing for military intervention to topple the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\n=== Bribery in defence contracts ===\nIn August 2012, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into bribery allegations in connection with a UK-Saudi Arabian defence contract between the EADS subsidiary GPT Special Project Management, and the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Exaro persistently investigated the allegations, writing more than twenty stories over seven months before the SFO launched its criminal investigation.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nPrivate Eye magazine wrote on 18 September 2015 that \"Exaro is struggling to live up to its strapline of 'holding power to account.' For several months the investigative site has published no news at all apart from the latest paedo developments and, slightly bizarrely, items on a corporate insolvency monitoring service it runs alongside its 'news.' The latter centres on the supposed 'Whitehall paedophile ring' and the lurid allegations against former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, and involves magnifying the slightest procedural development and tweeting like mad under the hashtag #VIPaedophile.\"\nBarrister Matthew Scott, a consistent critic of Exaro's modus operandi, wrote on his blog that the site \"has generated a poisonous atmosphere of outrage and hysteria in which wild and immensely hurtful accusations can be made and believed on the flimsiest of evidence; and that by publicising detailed allegations of paedophile orgies and murder it has risked destroying the prospect of fair trials either for victims or defendants.\" A report in The Guardian stated that the conduct of Exaro had been the subject of complaints to officials supporting the Goddard Inquiry into child abuse.\nDame Janet Smith called Exaro's editors \"irresponsible\" following the site's publication of a leaked draft copy of her report into child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile, stating that, “Exaro’s decision appears to have been taken for its own commercial gain without any thought for the interests of the many victims of Savile or the integrity of the reporting process.”\n\n\n== References ==",

Gary Coody, national health fraud coordinator for the FDA, described the purveyors of these unproven treatments as \"like storm-chasing roofers, who go and try to defraud people after a big storm. Some of them may be making an honest mistake; other companies are trying to rip people off.\" Coody also said the problem with implausible and unproven remedies is not only that they are unlikely to work, but also that such treatments may lead to patients delaying effective and timely medical care in a hospital setting.\n\n\n== Implausible and disproven methods for preventing Ebola ==\nDuring the 2014 and 2019 outbreaks, a number of hoax remedies for the prevention of Ebola were spread online. One such common thread was the frequent use of essential oils. There is no evidence that any of these treatments will decrease the risk of Ebola virus infection, and no known plausible mechanisms for such an effect.\n\n\n== Virus origins ==\nDuring the 2014 outbreak in Liberia, an article in the Liberian Observer alleged that the virus was a bioweapon designed by the US military as a form of population control. Other theories spreading online during the pandemic alleged that the New World Order had engineered the virus to impose quarantines and travel bans to soften an eventual descent into martial law. During a 2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, rumors spread that the virus was imported to the country for financial gain, or as part of a plot to procure organs for the black market.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Philosophy of conspiracy theories",
        "wikipedia_content": "Philosophy of conspiracy theories is the academic study by philosophers of the phenomenon and history of conspiracy theories. A conspiracy theory has been defined as an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups, often political in motivation, or more narrowly a conspiracy where other explanations are more probable. The term has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal to a conspiracy is based on prejudice or insufficient evidence.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe debate in analytic philosophy regarding conspiracy theories began in the mid-1990s when Charles Pigden challenged Karl Popper's position. Popper, an influential philosopher of science, described what he called the \"conspiracy theory of society\", according to which history is a product of conspiracy, intended by some individuals or groups. Popper argues that this view must be wrong because not everything is intended. Although Popper's critique has been and continues to be influential, Pigden has maintained that Popper's argument does not apply to most conspiracy theories, which do not posit complete control of events. Pigden also points out that when a conspiracy fails in some way, a theory about the conspiracy is still a conspiracy theory and may still play an explanatory role.\nBrian Keeley's 1999 essay, \"Of Conspiracy Theories\", which originally appeared in The Journal of Philosophy, prompted a new phase in the debate. Keeley focused on a subset of conspiracy theories that he called \"unwarranted conspiracy theories\" (UCTs). According to David Coady, Keeley argued that several generalizations about conspiracy theories \"suggest a prima facie case against belief in them\" (Coady 2006, p. 6). Lee Basham takes a more sympathetic view, suggesting we should adopt an attitude of \"studied agnosticism\" (Coady 2006, p. 7). Steve Clarke argues that because conspiracy theories overestimate dispositional explanations an attitude of prima facie skepticism towards them is warranted.\nIn 2007, a special issue of Episteme: A Journal of Social Epistemology contained several more essays that continued the debate. Therein, Neil Levy, in \"Radically Socialized Knowledge\", argues that conspiracy theories, conceived of as conflicting with officially endorsed accounts, \"should be treated with prima facie scepticism\" because they conflict with the views of the relevant epistemic authorities. Charles Pigden frames the issue in terms of the \"ethics of belief\". He argues that the conventional wisdom about conspiracy theories—that they \"should neither be believed nor investigated\"—is dangerously mistaken on any of a variety of interpretations of the phrase \"conspiracy theory\". More recently, philosophers and social scientists engaged in arguing over the nature of conspiracy theories and pejorative implications over policies and funding, to the extent this debate has been classified as a \"cross-disciplinary disagreement\".\n\n\n== Pejorative implications ==\nPhilosophers M Dentith and Brian Keeley have argued that defining conspiracy theories as being prima facie unlikely may result in prematurely dismissing theories that posit conspiracies.  Dentith, Keeley, and Basham favor minimalist definitions, defining \"conspiracy theories\" as theories involving conspiracies as a significant cause. This has been criticized by Coady as capturing too many false positives, including, for example, the official account of 9/11. Coady has suggested that a characteristic feature of conspiracy theories is their opposition to some official account. \nThe term \"conspiracy theory\" typically implies oppressive or sinister intent. The following philosophers have argued that such language overstates the case: \n\nSteve Clark (who argues that a dismissive attitude to conspiracy theories is generally justifiable) points out that Elvis Presley conspiring to fake his own death would not have been an example of nefarious intent, and that popularizers of that conspiracy theory have portrayed Elvis sympathetically.\nDaniel Cohnitz argues that in most versions of the Paul is dead conspiracy theory, the surviving Beatles and their co-conspirators had the non-malevolent motivation of trying to save the world from collective grief, and that some believers in chemtrails say they might be spreading chemicals for a beneficial purpose. Consequently, for Cohnitz, sinister intent should not be taken as a necessary component of the definition.\nPigden characterizes conspiracy theories as positing \"morally suspect\" enterprises.\nSusan Feldman has pointed out that beliefs designated as conspiracy theories may purport to explain, not events that have occurred or facts that are widely known, but \"hidden facts\".\nCoady suggests that the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" should not be used, while Dentith and Keeley maintain that it should continue to be used and to be discussed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConspiracy\nConspiracy theory\nConscious parallelism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n2007.

        "wikipedia_content": "SMOF (also spelled smof) is an acronym which stands for \"Secret Master(s) Of Fandom\" and is a term used within the science fiction fan community. Its coining is generally attributed to long-time science fiction fan and author Jack L. Chalker.\n\n\n== Capitalised meaning ==\nThe capitalised form of the term (SMOF) is used jokingly to refer to a clandestine cabal of top science fiction fans who, by their unseen influence, are controlling the actions of fandom. It is the SMOFs who are responsible for the trends and changes in the popularity of particular subgenres, media, or individual authors, films  or television series. As such, this use of the term is a light-hearted conspiracy theory.\n\n\n== Uncapitalised meaning ==\nThe more general, uncapitalised, form of the term (smof) is an honorific bestowed upon the fans who actually do the organisational work behind much of fandom or are stalwart members of the fannish community. This includes fans who are regarded highly by others for their work in running conventions, fanzines, and fan funds, and who work (for the most part) on an entirely voluntary basis for the good of fandom in general, as well as those whose standing is high within the fannish community by dint of their long participation in it.\nThe capitalization distinction is not rigidly observed; it is not unusual to capitalize the term even when it is being used in the more general sense, although the reverse (uncapitalized usage connoting the conspiracy humor) is rare.\n\n\n== Verb meaning ==\n\"SMOFing\" (or \"smoffing\") is used as a verb to refer to discussing the details or personalities involved in running a convention; when organizers talk amongst themselves about something related to fandom, they are SMOFing.\nAlthough by its nature informal, the term smof is now used by several science fiction convention management cooperative associations (some incorporated as non-profits, others simply ad hoc). For example, there is a smofs mailing list for Worldcon management, a yearly convention for SF con managers named SMOFcon, and a defunct website and series of meetings for convention runners in the Baltimore-Washington area of the USA run by an organization called BWSMOF.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest known citation is from the New York Times, in an issue published on September 6, 1971. The term appears in the 1978 edition of Wilson Tucker's Neo-Fan's Guide to Science Fiction Fandom. It does not appear in the 1955 or 1966 editions of that work (the 1973 and 1975 editions have not yet been checked).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Conrunner's Wiki\nOED Citations for SMOF",

        "wikipedia_content": "The Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media (SPM) is a controversial group of academics and activists whose stated purpose is to study propaganda and information operations surrounding the Syrian civil war. It was formed by environmental political theory professor Tim Hayward and former academic Piers Robinson in 2017.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe group has gained attention and attracted criticism for disputing the veracity of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War as well as for its claims that the Syrian White Helmets civil defence organisation has staged false flag attacks in order to trigger Western retaliation against the Syrian government.\nThe group has produced a number of reports. The SPM's first publication, entitled, \"Doubts about 'Novichoks',\" questioned whether Russia's secret nerve agent programme – through which Novichok chemical weapons were developed – had ever existed.\nIn subsequent publications, the SPM has argued that the 2018 Douma chemical attack was faked by the White Helmets civil defence organisation. The SPM report accused Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former head of Britain's Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, of being an agent working on behalf of a British covert influence programme.\nAccording to Bellingcat, the group used other entities such as Berlin Group 21 (BG21) as their front for publishing \"statements of concern\". In October 2019, a former Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) employee later identified as Brendan Whelan presented his dissent with the OPCW's findings about the investigation of the Douma chemical attack. Members of the Courage Foundation who attended included Kristinn Hrafnsson, Jose Bustani, Helmut Lohre and Gunter Meyer. Courage Foundation published the Statement of Concern at the same time as \"Berlin Group 21\". Whelan later leaked OPCW documents to WikiLeaks.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn early 2018, The Times newspaper ran a series of articles critical of the SPM, in which it said the group intentionally spreads \"disinformation\" in support of the government of Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War and \"conspiracy theories promoted by Russia\". The Times described the group's members as \"apologists for Assad\" and likened them to Holocaust deniers. In response, the SPM said that its members have a shared interest in \"investigating the 'information operations' (...) associated with the Syrian conflict\" and stressed that \"the Working Group does not take any position for or against the Syrian government.\"\nA March 2018 BBC News article stated that the SPM had, \"echoed [...] Russian disinformation narratives,\" in a number of publications by suggesting that the governments of the United States and United Kingdom had a motive to kill Russian dissident Sergei Skripal in order to prevent him from testifying in a libel case against former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. The view of the UK government is that Skripal, a former Russian spy, was poisoned by Russian secret service agents.\nIn 2019, The Huffington Post wrote that SPM \"reported on the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, chemical attacks in Syria and a British organisation that counters Russian propaganda but its findings have been described by experts as “speculation”, “distortion” and “in the realm of conspiracy theorists”\". It quoted Kristyan Benedict, a crisis response manager for Amnesty International UK, who accused SPM of promoting conspiracy theories and denying war crimes. It also noticed that SPM cofounder Piers Robinson is a 9/11 truther.\nIn 2021, Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) reported on its sting operation targeting SPM member Paul McKeigue, in which CIJA posed over email as a Russian agent named \"Ivan.\" McKeigue corresponded with \"Ivan\" over the course of several months, believing that he was communicating with Russian secret services. According to CIJA, SPM attempted to coordinate with Russian diplomats including Alexander Shulgin, Russia's ambassador to the Netherlands, on publications about Syria. The report also stated that McKeigue obtained legal advice from Melinda Taylor, one of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's personal lawyers, on how to make litigious claims against the OPCW which McKeigue referred to as \"lawfare\", a term generally used to describe frivolous or harassing litigation. McKeigue and Taylor also discussed promoting claims of fraud against CIJA.\nAccording to CIJA, its \"investigation revealed that, far from being fringe conspiracists, these revisionists, employed by some of the UK’s top universities, were collaborating with Russian diplomats in four countries; were willing to co-operate with presumed Russian security agents to advance their agenda and to attack their opponents; were co-ordinating dissemination of disinformation with bloggers, alternative media and Russian state media; appeared to be planning the doxxing of survivors of chemical attacks; and admitted to making up sources and facts when necessary to advance their cause.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nMembers of the SPM include:\n\nTim Hayward, environmental political theory professor, University of Edinburgh\nPiers Robinson, former academic\nMichael Kobs (Independent Researcher)\nAdam Larson (Independent Researcher)\nDavid Miller, sociologist, University of Bristol\nPaul McKeigue, genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics professor\nJan Oberg, Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research\nVanessa Beeley, activist and blogger\nTara McCormack, international relations lecturer, University of Leicester\nOliver Boyd-Barrett, professor emeritus, Bowling Green State University\nCarmen Renieri (Independent Researcher)\nGreg Simons, lecturer, Institute for Russian and Eurasian Studies, Uppsala University\nFlorian Zollmann, Newcastle University\nMembers of its advisory board have included: \n\nMark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies, New York University.\nPhilip Hammond, professor of media & communications, London South Bank University.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "title": "Conspiracy theory (legal term)",
        "wikipedia_content": "In law, a conspiracy theory is a theory of a case that presents a conspiracy to be considered by a trier of fact. A basic tenet of \"traditional 'conspiracy theory'\" is that each co-conspirator is liable for acts of co-conspirators \"during the existence of and in furtherance of the conspiracy\". Procedures and proof requirements for conspiracy theory litigation as well as the definition of 'conspiracy' vary by jurisdiction (British, U.S., …) and body of law (criminal, civil, …). In civil litigation, it can offer advantages relative to aiding-and-abetting or joint tortfeasor case theories.\n\n\n== Conspiracy, theory, and conspiracy theory litigation ==\nIn popular usage, the term ‘conspiracy’ means a secret agreement of two or more persons usually to commit a bad act. In a broad legal sense, it is an agreement to commit an unlawful act; in British and some American courts, lawful acts finish in an unlawful manner (in British parlance, a ‘conspiracy to injure’; in American, a ‘true conspiracy’) are also included. Some states require an overt act. (Common law rule does not.) Whereas in a criminal conspiracy, the substantive offense is a crime, in civil law, the wrong is most likely a recognized intentional tort.\nA theory of a case (aka ‘case theory’) is “a detailed, coherent, accurate story of what occurred\" involving both legal theory (i.e., claims/causes of action or affirmative defenses) and factual theory (i.e., an explanation of how a particular course of events could have happened).\nParticular classes of conspiracy theories address, e.g., antitrust (per Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1) and RICO. A prominent concept in conspiracy law is Pinkerton liability where a conspiracy theory can be used to hold a co-conspirator liable for a substantive offense committed by another co-conspirator “if the offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the agreement”. In civil law, a conspiracy theory 1) exempts co-conspirator testimony from the rule against hearsay; 2) exposes deep-pocket defendants to more liability than available under an aiding-and-abetting theory; 3) can impose joint liability on non-residents of the jurisdiction not liable under joint tortfeasor theory.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nFrom a 9th Circuit case: \"In the taxonomy of conspiracy theories, a 'chain conspiracy' is one in which each person is responsible for a distinct act within the overall plan, while a 'wheel conspiracy' involves a single member or group, i.e., the 'hub', separately agreeing with two or more other members or groups, i.e., the 'spokes'.\"\n\n\n== Examples of term conspiracy theory in use ==\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor: \"A conspiracy theory says you don't have to commit every act.\" (Comment during oral argument in Husky International Electronics, Inc., v. Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr.)\nIn Federal jury instructions: \"… There was evidence that the defendant masterminded the narcotics conspiracy and the plan to rob the undercover officer, and that evidence fully justified the defendant's conviction on an accomplice or conspiracy theory, regardless of where he was on the date of the murder.

Alibi—Explained, Second Circuit)\nIn preparation for the Nuremberg trials: \"The American proposal is that we utilize the conspiracy theory by which a common plan or understanding to accomplish an illegal end by any mean, or to accomplish any end by illegal means, renders everyone who participated liable for the acts of every other.\" (From the Minutes of Conference Session of July 4, 1945.

        "title": "Institut Nova Història",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Institut Nova Història (INH, \"New History Institute\") is a Catalan cultural foundation with headquarters in Barcelona committed to historical journalism research. Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer Jordi Bilbeny, hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or \"Castilian\") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. The foundation promotes research, study and dissemination through publications, conferences, documentaries and symposia of its vision of Catalan history, in particular the annual \"Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America\" in Arenys de Munt. This has led them to create a \"history of their own\" whose theses, \"more or less picturesques,” are rejected by academia. Alberto Reig Tapia, from University of Rovira i Virgili considers that their members do not make history but \"Parody of History.\" Josep Colomer, from Georgetown University, has called them “cartoon satirists.” The Institut Nova Història claims that major historical figures, including Christopher Columbus, Erasmus, Miguel de Cervantes, Leonardo da Vinci, Saint Teresa of Ávila and others were Catalan. It is funded by the Catalan autonomous government, and has received support from Catalan nationalist politicians. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe INH was created in 2007 following a split in the Foundation of Historical Studies of Catalonia. The principal researcher of the INH is Jordi Bilbeny, a member of the \"Arenysian Movement for Self-Determination\", a local independentist movement, and of the Arenys de Munt's Popular Unity Candidacy, who launched the \"Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America\" in 2001. From its inception, the INH has undertaken the study and dissemination of the alleged Catalan background and/or culture of Christopher Columbus, Miguel de Cervantes, Lazarillo de Tormes, all topics put forward by Bilbeny. The president of the Institute is Albert Codinas, vice president of the Fundació Catalunya Estat, secretary of the Associació Catalunya 2014, and co-founder of the Platform for the Right to Decide. Víctor Cucurull, another researcher, is president of the Fundació Societat i Cultura, and a member of the national secretariat of the Catalan National Assembly\nThe INH has supported and organized, together with the municipality of Arenys de Munt, the Simposis sobre la descoberta catalana d'Amèrica (Symposia on the Catalan Discovery of America), held since 2001, where speakers present research on the alleged Discovery of the Americas by the Catalans. In 2013, the Institute organized the first Universitat Nova Història in Pla de l'Estany, under the sponsorship of the Provincial Council of Girona, the municipality of Arenys de Mar, Cercle Català de Negocis (Catalan Business Circle), asamblea.cat, the Regional Council of Pla de l'Estany and Fundació Catalunya Estat.\n\n\n== Theories ==\n\nThe INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish (\"Castilian\") state. By minimising the role of Catalonia—or the Crown of Aragon—in Spanish collective history through falsification, concealment and censorship or \"appropriation\" of certain historical episodes, the prevalence of Castilian ideology is established. Among its claims are:\n\nThat Christopher Columbus, who discovered the Americas, was a Catalan; that his real name was Joan Colom i Bertran; that he was \"a Catalan noble that fought against Ferdinand II in the Catalan Civil War of 1462-1472 and so needed to change his identity in order to avoid persecution by royalist forces\"; and that he sailed from the port of Pals rather than from Palos de Moguer.   The theory is not new; it was originally proposed by Peruvian historian Luis Ulloa Cisneros in Paris in 1927.\nThat Erasmus of Rotterdam was actually named Ferran, and was the second son of this Joan Colom i Bertran (Columbus).\nThat Hernán Cortés was actually Ferran Cortès, a Catalan noble; Francisco Pizarro was Francesc Pinós De So i Carròs; Diego de Almagro's real name was Jaume d'Aragó-Dalmau; Amerigo Vespucci's last name was a distortion of the surname \"Despuig\", and his voyage to the new world was made in the name of the \"King of Catalonia\". Thus, the feat of discovery and conquest was accomplished entirely by Catalans, the only people who sailed to the Americas before 1518.\nThat Miguel de Cervantes was a Catalan, whose real name was Joan Miquel Servent, and who was a native of Xixona; that Don Quixote was a faulty translation of the original work in Catalan, El Quixot, which was destroyed by the Castilians, and \"passed off as Castilian\".\nThat Leonardo da Vinci was Catalan, born in a town near Montserrat, such as Manresa, Vic or La Garriga; that Mona Lisa was actually Isabella of Aragon; that the mountains depicted at the bottom of the portrait were the Montserrat mountain range; and that Da Vinci's coat of arms was very similar to that of the \"Catalan Royal House\". These ideas were put forward in a 2014 documentary, Desmutant Leonardo (Deconstructing Leonardo), on El Punt Avui TV.\nThat the original versions of La Celestina and Lazarillo de Tormes—the latter having been written by Joan Timoneda—were in Catalan and were destroyed after having been translated into Castilian.\nThat Saint Teresa of Ávila was actually Teressa Enrìques de Cardona, abbess at the Monastery of Pedralbes for thirty years.\nThat the first university founded in the Iberian Peninsula was the University of Barcelona, rather than the universities of Salamanca and Palencia.\nThat the design of the flag of the United States of America was inspired by the Catalan senyera.\n\n\n== Support from Catalans ==\nThe INH is linked to organizations funded by the Catalan autonomous government. It has collaborated with the separatist Catalan National Assembly in organising conferences on the history of Catalonia. In 2013 it was one of the recipients of the Premi Nacional President Lluís Companys (President Lluís Companys National Awards) by the Sants-Montjuïc branch of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya.  In 2012 the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Jordi Pujol, wrote to Bilbeny congratulating him on his book Discovery and Catalan conquest of America. A history rewritten by the Castilians, noting that the books published by the INH \"are very convincing\", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's Brief account of the destruction of history, where he spoke in praise of the book.\nThe 2015 INH symposium in Arenys de Munt, under the title \"The Catalan Discovery of America\", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and Arenys de Mar, together with associations such as the Ateneu Independentista of Arenys de Munt. Muriel Casals, representative of the separatist coalition Junts pel Sí, gave the closing speech entitled \"From the erased past to political independence\".\nINH members have given talks on their theories in the main Catalan government-owned television and radio channels such as TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe INH has been described by one academic as \"a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile\". In 2019, a group of four Catalan historians publicly denounced the INH, calling it \"a sect, not to say a drug\" of \"people who have never visited an archive\" and likening it to flat Earthers. It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party Ciudadanos spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as \"ridiculous\". In August 2019 Gabriel Rufián, spokesman for Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) also criticized INH saying that \"No pseudo-science, pseudo-history should be funded with public money. It only serves those who wish to portray us as small, ridiculous and angry losers.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nReig Tapia, Alberto (2021). El desafío secesionista catalán. El pasado de una ilusión.

        "wikipedia_content": "The Lumber Cartel was a facetious conspiracy theory popularized on USENET that claimed anti-spammers were secretly paid agents of lumber companies.\nIn November 1997, a participant on news.admin.net-abuse.email posted an essay to the newsgroup. The essay described a conspiracy theory:\n\nThe original anti-spammer was in truth a major spammer just one day before two major lumber companies deposited a total of $275,000 into his account. He instantly stopped spamming and began what is now the biggest anti-spam ring on the Internet.\nThe reasoning provided in the essay was that certain companies first destroy forests and make paper out of them, which is in turn used to send bulk mail. Since sending e-mail spam does not use paper at all, the essay argued, the lumber companies would want to stop it before it would surpass paper-based bulk mailing, and consequently only those in the pay of the lumber companies would be anti-spam.\nThe rationale was based in disclaimers in certain spam messages that they were using electronic means in order to save paper. The joke eventually led to a club and numerous parody websites, most of which have long since disappeared.\nGatherings of anti-spammers on Usenet began to ridicule proponents of this theory, and many participants in news.admin.net-abuse.email chose to dub themselves as members of \"the Lumber Cartel\" in their signatures, followed immediately by the acronymic disclaimer \"TinLC\" (There is no Lumber Cartel), reminiscent of the There Is No Cabal catchphrase.  People were able to register with a website about the Lumber Cartel and were given a  sequential membership number. That was added to email sig files in news.admin.net-abuse.email and used on personal websites. There was no verification or requirement to receive the membership number.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture jamming\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHow the Lumber Cartel started\nThe Canadian Branch of the Lumber Cartel (local 42)\nThe Netherlands Lumber Cartel\nThe United Kingdom Lumber Cartel in Craggy Island\nThe ZhongGuo (China) Lumber Cartel, local 88\nThe Jargon File: \"Lumber Cartel\"\nGlossary at the Abusive Hosts Blocklist\nOther Ways to Fry Spam at Wired\nGambling Magazine's 1999 article on spam, mentioning the Lumber Cartel\nThe Lumber Cartel's DNS-based blackhole list\nThe Lumber Cartel's \"Offishul\" page.\nSalon.com's 1999 article on anti-spam efforts, mentioning the Lumber Cartel",

        "title": "SS Scillin",
        "wikipedia_content": "SS Scillin was a 1,591 GRT cargo steamship that was built in Scotland in 1903, passed through a succession of owners of various nationalities and had a succession of different names. She was built as H. M. Pellatt but was successively called Memling, Nicole Le Borgne, Giuliana Pagan, and Scillin Secondo before becoming Scillin in 1937.\nBy the time of the Second World War the ship was in Italian ownership. In 1942, a Royal Navy submarine sank her in the Mediterranean Sea when she was transporting over 800 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) from North Africa to Italy, killing nearly all of them. The United Kingdom kept the cause of her sinking secret until 1996, more than 50 years after the event.\n\n\n== History ==\nRussell and Company of Greenock, Renfrewshire built the ship in 1903 as H. M. Pellatt for William Petersen Ltd of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She had a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine built by David Rowan and Company of Glasgow. It developed 196 NHP and drove her single screw, giving her a speed of 11 knots (20 km/h).\nThe Canadian Lake and Ocean Navigation Co of Newcastle bought H. M. Pellatt in 1905 and sold her in 1911 to the Merchants Mutual Line, also of Newcastle. Canadian Northern Steamships of London bought her in 1917 and sold her in 1918 to Canada Steamship Lines Ltd of Montreal. In 1920 the Société Belge d'Armement Maritime bought the ship and renamed her Memling. In 1924 or 1925 the Compagnie Charles Le Borgne of Marseille bought the ship and renamed her Nicole Le Borgne. In 1934 Giuseppe Pagan of Venice bought the ship and renamed her Giuliana Pagan. In 1935 Aurora SA di Navigazione of Genoa bought the ship and renamed her Scillin Secondo. In 1837 the company shortened her name to Scillin. By 1941 she was owned by Fratelli Bianchi Societá Di Navigazione of Genoa.\n\n\n== Final voyage ==\nIn November 1942, in Tripoli, Libya, 814 Allied POWs were embarked in Scillin's hold, which, reportedly, was suitable for only about 300. The result was severe overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. More prisoners would have been embarked, but the British military doctor (Captain Gilbert, RAMC) made vehement and repeated protests. Some reports state that a further 195 POWs were embarked before Scillin sailed and that there were some 200 Italian troops aboard; others dispute these points saying that the only Italian troops aboard were guards and gun crews and the surplus POWs were never actually embarked. She sailed on 13 November 1942.\nA British S-class submarine, HMS Sahib, intercepted Scillin on the night of 14 November off the coast of Tunisia. Sahib first fired two shells at the cargo ship and then launched a single torpedo, which hit Scillin's hold and rapidly sank her. Prisoners in the hold had little chance of survival. Sahib rescued 27 POWs (26 British and one South African), Scillin's captain and 34 Italian crew and soldiers before the arrival of an Italian warship obliged her to leave. Only when Sahib's crew heard survivors speaking English did they realise the ship's purpose.\n\n\n== Official reaction ==\n\nRoyal Navy submarine commanders had been ordered not to attack enemy civilian ships that were en route from North Africa to Italy. In an inquiry, Sahib's commander (Lt John Bromage) was cleared of culpability, since he claimed that Scillin had borne no lights, he had believed that Scillin was carrying Italian troops, had appeared to be en route to Africa and had not responded to the initial shelling (two rounds), intended to halt her. \nIn his log Lt Bromage never claimed to have fired any warning shots.\n\n\"Fired 12 rounds with the 3\" gun and registered with 10\". The ship was brought to. Closed to 750yds and fired one Torpedo into the engine room.Sgt W D Heath R.T.R. (survivor) mistook the missed rounds as warning shots.\"\nThe patrol report clearly indicates that the Sahib was put on a course to intercept Scillin. The order came from Malta and was received during a radio listening watch as recorded in Lt Bromage's log.\nConsideration was given to the prosecution of Italians for war crimes because of Scillin's lack of life-saving equipment and Italian attempts to batten down (i.e. close) her hatches where the POWs were kept, thus preventing their escape. Prosecution was abandoned due to lack of evidence. 787 or 788 POWs died aboard Scillin. Another source mentions 806 POWs lost, as well as 79 Italians.\n\n\n== Secrecy and disclosure ==\nThe details of Scillin's loss and the circumstances of the death of the Allied POWs were kept secret for more than 50 years until persistent inquiries by relations and historians brought a more open response. The reasons for such official reticence for such a long period are not clear, but there are claims that it was deemed necessary to protect intelligence sources.\nThe first time information was made public was in 1996 when the Ministry of Defence records department put an account of the sinking and a list of POWs into an existing file at The National Archives. (WO311/304) Both the account of the sinking and the list of casualties were factually flawed. When the mistakes were pointed out the MoD accepted the errors, but no alterations have been made.\nIt was deemed important to conceal the source of the intelligence (Ultra) that so accurately predicted Scillin's position and schedule, enabling Sahib to intercept her, and also revealed that POWs were aboard. It should be remembered that Ultra was highly secret and great efforts were made to prevent the Axis discovering or disclosing that their signals were being read; Ultra's existence was not publicly disclosed until the 1970s.\nMany measures were applied to protect Ultra intelligence. One was to overfly any intended shipping target before directing any interception and attack. Scillin's crew were interrogated when they were landed at Malta and disclosed that the ship had been sighted by aerial reconnaissance. Sahib was then given an interception course. This was standard practice when attacking shipping whose movements had been revealed by Ultra whether they had POW aboard or not. Thus if transports that carried POW were not attacked at all it would have been obvious that the Allies had prior knowledge of the ships' cargo.\nThe most complete account of Scillin's sinking and the role of Ultra was published in the September 2006 issue of the Royal Artillery Journal.\n\n\n== Previous losses ==\nScillin was only one example of Allied POWs being killed when enemy ships were sunk in the Mediterranean. Five others had been sunk in the preceding year with 2,000 casualties; Ultra had predicted each of the POW transportations. There is a memorial plaque at the National Memorial Arboretum to the POWs lost at sea on Sebastiano Veniero (9 December 1941), Ariosto (15 February 1942), Tembien (27 February 42), Nino Bixio (17 August 1942), Loreto (13 October 1942) and Scillin (14 November 1942).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\nGreene, Jack; Massignani, Alessandro (1994).

        "title": "Operations plan",
        "wikipedia_content": "The Operations plan (Spanish: Plan de Operaciones) is a secret document attributed to Mariano Moreno, that set harsh ways for the Primera Junta, the first de facto independent government of Argentina in the 19th century, to achieve its goals. Some historians consider it a literary forgery, and others consider it true.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nAccording to historians who consider the document to be real, the need for it would have been the result of a meeting of Moreno, Manuel Belgrano, and Juan José Castelli, the latter two requesting  Moreno to write it; by August 31, 1810, he proposed it to the whole Junta.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Actions against royalists ===\n\nMariano Moreno did not consider necessary to take any measures against absolutist monarchy itself. He thought that, in the wake of the events of the Peninsular War, the House of Bourbon had destroyed itself, and it would be enough to simply let it stay that way.\nThe document states the need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering that it would be dangerous during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still in its early steps, with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing that none of those relied solely in conspirations or secret meetings.\nThe document divides people into three main groups, loyals, open enemies and neutrals. It proposes to give privileges to the loyals, and fill the state offices with them, but using circumstantial honours rather than rushed promotions. Moreno made an exception with moderated supporters driven by a desire of honours or recognition, he considered that they may be useful at a later stage of the revolution, but not at the early ones. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta; and executed when they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. Top military or political personnel, such as enemy governors or generals, should be executed after their capture. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. In respect to the press, the document proposed to give broad press coverage to the news that may benefit the government and conceal the ones that may harm it.\nMoreno thought that a blockade against Montevideo would not be effective, for the Montevidean naval supremacy over Buenos Aires. He proposed instead to weaken Montevideo by getting the support of the nearby smaller cities and villages. Moreno thought as well that José Gervasio Artigas and José Rondeau would be invaluable allies, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have them join the fight against absolutism. Once the city was captured, he proposed to confiscate the ships and properties of royalists. All the people that could not prove loyalty to the cause would be banished to the Malvinas or Carmen de Patagones, or drafted in the army for 15 years; the old people would be only banished, but spared from prison or hard works.\nHe also noticed the internal conflicts at Chile and Paraguay, and urged to provide support to the local patriots against the local royalists.\nThe text was abolitionist as well. It proposed to end the slave trade, and emancipate the slaves with peninsular masters. To avoid conflicts with patriots owners of slaves, those slaves would be drafted into the militias, with the option of becoming free negros after their military service.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\nOn the level of international relations, Mariano Moreno rejected the slavery in Brazil, a neighbour Portuguese colony. He proposed to distribute large numbers of Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspapers, filled with libertarian ideas and translated to Portuguese language, and provide military support to the slaves that may riot. He considered a great menace the risk of a complete Spanish defeat in the Peninsular War or a restoration of absolutism and regarded Britain as a potential ally against such menaces. During a conflict, Britain would be able to provide them with weapons, and other goods that were not produced locally. Critics of Moreno consider him an Anglophile because of this proposal, but the same documents warns later against the risk of Britain having too much influence in the economic life of the country. He also criticized the relation between Britain and Portugal, considering that Portugal was subject to a \"shameful slavery\" to Britain, and that the British influence in Brazil was so high that the Portuguese colonies may eventually become British ones. Moreno held the same ideas about being friendly but cautious with Britain in the pages of the Gazeta newspaper.\nIn respect to the relation with Spain, Moreno thought that a premature declaration of independence would not be appropriate, and advised to wait for the revolution to strengthen and to see the final outcome of the Peninsular War. He thought that it was advisable to proclaim loyalty to Ferdinand VII at every document, as it would ease the relation with foreign countries, and Spain itself would doubt which party, the patriots or the royalists, was more loyal to the king.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nIn the economic field, it addressed the lack of a bourgeoisie that may turn the political changes into economic development and proposed to overcome such lack with an active state intervention. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state destined 200 or 300 million to create factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage those businesses. With the money generated from those activities, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically self-reliant. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate it, and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousands would be benefited. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just watch the activities, making sure that they followed laws enacted for the common good of society.\nThe early 19th-century liberalism did not promote confiscation among their common proposals, but a similar antecedent of this proposal was the Conspiracy of the Equals, promoted by François-Noël Babeuf during the French Revolution. Moreno thought that state-sized fortunes managed by a few individuals were detrimental to civil society, and those individuals would tend to take up the roles of the state in their own benefit, but without fixing the problems of society at large.\nThe document proposed as well to avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs to the import of luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction with The Representation of the Hacendados, but both ones request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition to trade with Britain, which is not the same as allowing it but following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs over national exports, but kept high ones for imports, which would only be removed during the First Triumvirate, years later.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe first copy of the Plan was found in the Archives of Indias of Sevilla (Spain) by Eduardo Madero, who was studying the history of the port of Buenos Aires. He sent it to Argentina. Bartolomé Mitre received it but lost it, in unknown circumstances. Norberto Piñeiro found a second one, but instead of sending it back to Buenos Aires, he published it. Other historians would later draw relations between the Plan and the government acts of the Junta such as the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the Liniers Counter-revolution or the work of Castelli at the Upper Peru.\nHistorian Paul Groussac and later Ricardo Levene accused the document of being a forgery, written by an enemy of the revolution in order to discredit it. Levene also insisted in that the copy found was not handwritten by Mariano Moreno but by Andrés Álvarez de Toledo. Supporters of the document accepted it, stating that the document found was not the original but a copy, and that it was not something unexpected that the copy was handwritten by another man. The original document, handwritten by Mariano Moreno, has not been discovered yet.\nNo other texts of the time written by the members of the Junta, either public or private, make mention to the Operations plan. However, Enrique Ruiz Guiñazú published in 1952 a pair of letters of Carlota Joaquina and Ferdinand VII, where both members of the house of Bourbon make direct reference to the plan written by Moreno. Carlota also cited in it parts of such document, which are coherent with the copy found by Piñeiro.\nLater, some authors question the authorship of Moreno, and stated that some expressions or redaction styles may suggest it to be the work of Manuel Belgrano or Hipólito Vieytes. Supporters of the document like Norberto Galasso accept a middle ground option: the document may be the result of a collaborative writing instead that of a single author, even if Moreno wrote most of it.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMariano Moreno\nPrimera Junta\nMay Revolution\n\n\n== References ==\nGalasso, Norberto (2004).
